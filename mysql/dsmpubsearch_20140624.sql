All rights reserved.','\r\nBACKGROUND:\r\nThe postpericardiotomy syndrome (PPS) is a common complication following cardiac surgery. The pathophysiology remains unclear, although evidence exists that surgical trauma and the use of cardiopulmonary bypass provoke an immune response leading to PPS. We hypothesized that an intraoperative dose of dexamethasone decreases the risk of PPS, by reducing this inflammatory response.\r\nMETHODS:\r\nWe performed a subanalysis of the DECS study, which is a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial of 4,494 patients undergoing cardiac surgery with use of cardiopulmonary bypass. The aim of the DECS study was to investigate whether a single intraoperative dose of 1 mg/kg dexamethasone reduced the incidence of a composite of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, renal failure, or respiratory failure, within 30 days of randomization. In this substudy, we retrospectively analyzed the occurrence of PPS in 822 patients who were included in the DECS trial and underwent valvular surgery. Postpericardiotomy syndrome was diagnosed if 2 of 5 listed symptoms were present: unexplained fever, pleuritic chest pain, pericardial or pleural rub, new or worsening pericardial or pleural effusion. All medical charts, x-rays, and echocardiograms were reviewed. Secondary end point was the occurrence of complicated PPS, defined as PPS with need for evacuation of pleural effusion, pericardiocentesis, and tamponade requiring intervention or hospital readmission for PPS. This is a blinded, single-center, post hoc analysis.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nPostpericardiotomy syndrome occurred in 119 patients (14.5%). The incidence of PPS after dexamethasone compared with placebo was 13.5% vs 15.5% (relative risk 0.88, 95% CI 0.63-1.22). For complicated PPS, the incidence was 3.8% versus 3.2% (relative risk 1.17, 95% CI 0.57-2.41, P = .66), respectively.\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\nIn patients undergoing valvular cardiac surgery, high-dose dexamethasone treatment had no protective effect on the occurrence of PPS or complicated PPS.','2014','Jul','','2014-06-24 19:16:42',NULL,1,1),(2,1,'nick@masomurray.com','24951538','1755-3245','Cardiovascular research','Expression of fibulin-6 in failing hearts and its role for cardiac fibroblast migration.','Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology. All rights reserved. © The Author 2014. For permissions please email: journals.permissions@oup.com.','\r\nAIMS:\r\nThe cardiac extracellular matrix (ECM) undergoes a dynamic transition following myocardial infarction. Fibulin-6, an ECM protein is expressed in cell junctions particularly in tissues subjected to significant mechanical stress. Fibulin-6 deficiency results in defective cell migration in nematodes and early embryonic lethality in mice. The role of fibulin-6 in healthy and failing myocardium has not been described. We have examined the expression and distribution pattern of fibulin-6 during myocardial remodeling (MR) and detailed its effect on the migratory function of cardiac fibroblasts (CF) in response to TGF-β1.\r\nMETHODS AND RESULTS:\r\nIn healthy murine myocardium fibulin-6 expression is largely confined to larger coronary arteries. It is induced during the early and the late phase of remodeling after infarction in murine hearts predominantly in the scar-muscle junction. Similar results are obtained in human ischemic cardiomyopathy. Fibulin-6 is mostly expressed in close vicinity to vimentin positive cells and is also abundantly expressed in vitro in cultured neonatal CF. TGF-β1 does not induce smooth muscle actin in fibroblasts deficient of fibulin-6, which also compromised their migration. Cells that had migrated expressed more fibulin-6 compared to stationary cells. Plated on fibulin-6 depleted matrix, stress fiber induction in fibroblast in response to TGF-β1 was impaired. In ex vivo explant cultures from postinfarct myocardium, the number of emigrating fibroblasts was also significantly reduced by fibulin-6 siRNA knock down (KD).\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\nFibulin-6, a fibroblast released ECM protein may play an important role during myocardial remodeling by imparting an effect on cardiac fibroblast migration in close and complementary interplay with TGF-β1 signalling.','2014','Jun','20','2014-06-24 19:16:42',NULL,1,1),(3,1,'nick@masomurray.com','24948576','1569-9285','Interactive cardiovascular and thoracic surgery','Computational fluid dynamics of the right ventricular outflow tract and of the pulmonary artery: a bench model of flow dynamics.','© The Author 2014. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery. All rights reserved.','\r\nOBJECTIVES:\r\nThe reconstruction of the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) with valved conduits remains a challenge. The reoperation rate at 5 years can be as high as 25% and depends on age, type of conduit, conduit diameter and principal heart malformation. The aim of this study is to provide a bench model with computer fluid dynamics to analyse the haemodynamics of the RVOT, pulmonary artery, its bifurcation, and left and right pulmonary arteries that in the future may serve as a tool for analysis and prediction of outcome following RVOT reconstruction.\r\nMETHODS:\r\nPressure, flow and diameter at the RVOT, pulmonary artery, bifurcation of the pulmonary artery, and left and right pulmonary arteries were measured in five normal pigs with a mean weight of 24.6 ± 0.89 kg. Data obtained were used for a 3D computer fluid-dynamics simulation of flow conditions, focusing on the pressure, flow and shear stress profile of the pulmonary trunk to the level of the left and right pulmonary arteries.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nThree inlet steady flow profiles were obtained at 0.2, 0.29 and 0.36 m/s that correspond to the flow rates of 1.5, 2.0 and 2.5 l/min flow at the RVOT. The flow velocity profile was constant at the RVOT down to the bifurcation and decreased at the left and right pulmonary arteries. In all three inlet velocity profiles, low sheer stress and low-velocity areas were detected along the left wall of the pulmonary artery, at the pulmonary artery bifurcation and at the ostia of both pulmonary arteries.\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\nThis computed fluid real-time model provides us with a realistic picture of fluid dynamics in the pulmonary tract area. Deep shear stress areas correspond to a turbulent flow profile that is a predictive factor for the development of vessel wall arteriosclerosis. We believe that this bench model may be a useful tool for further evaluation of RVOT pathology following surgical reconstructions.','2014','Jun','19','2014-06-24 19:16:42',NULL,1,1),(4,1,'nick@masomurray.com','24937347','1526-7598','Anesthesia and analgesia','The Long-Term Impact of Early Cardiovascular Therapy Intensification for Postoperative Troponin Elevation after Major Vascular Surgery.','','\r\nBACKGROUND::\r\nAcute cardiac events are a frequent cause of morbidity after vascular surgery. The impact of early evidence-based treatment for patients with an acute cardiac event after vascular surgery on long-term postoperative outcomes has not been extensively studied. We hypothesized that providing appropriate evidence-based treatment to patients with elevated postoperative cardiac troponin levels may limit long-term mortality.\r\nMETHODS::\r\nWe conducted a study of 667 consecutive major vascular surgery patients with an elevated postoperative troponin I level. We then determined which of these patients received medical therapy as per the 2007 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association recommendations for the medical management of patients with chronic stable angina. All patients with troponin elevation were then matched with 2 control patients without postoperative troponin elevation. Matching was done using logistic regression and nearest-neighbor matching methods. The primary study end point was 12 months survival without a major cardiac event (i.e., death, myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, or pulmonary edema requiring hospitalization).\r\nRESULTS::\r\nTherapy was intensified in 43 of 66 patients (65%) who suffered a troponin I elevation after surgery. Patients with a troponin I elevation not receiving intensified cardiovascular treatment had a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.77 (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.13-2.42; P = 0.004) for the primary study outcome as compared with the control group. In contrast, patients with a troponin I elevation who received intensified cardiovascular treatment had an HR of 0.63 (95% CI, 0.10-1.19; P = 0.45) for the primary outcome as compared with the control group. Patients with a troponin I elevation not receiving treatment intensification likely were at higher risk for a major cardiac event (HR, 2.80; 95% CI, 1.05-24.2; P = 0.04) compared with patients who did receive treatment intensification.\r\nCONCLUSIONS::\r\nThe main finding of this study was that in patients with elevated troponin I levels after noncardiac surgery, long-term adverse cardiac outcomes may likely be improved by following evidence-based recommendations for the medical management of acute coronary syndromes.','2014','Jun','16','2014-06-24 19:16:42',NULL,1,1),(5,1,'nick@masomurray.com','24937201','2329-0358','Annals of transplantation : quarterly of the Polish Transplantation Society','Comparative analysis of the quality of life for patients prior to and after heart transplantation.','','Background The aim of this study was to assess the quality of life of patients before and after heart transplantation (HTX).

This prospective study investigated the predictive value of a depressed intraoperative global longitudinal strain (GLS) for postoperative atrial fibrillation after isolated aortic valve replacement in patients with preserved ejection fraction.\r\nMETHODS:\r\nA total of 107 patients with ejection fraction ≥50% and moderate-to-severe aortic stenosis undergoing isolated aortic valve replacement were enrolled. All patients underwent intraoperative transoesophageal echocardiography before surgical incision (T1) and after closure of the sternotomy (T2) with semiautomated measurement of GLS, and were followed for the occurrence of postoperative atrial fibrillation during the hospitalization.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nThe incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation was 37/107 (34.6%). Patients with postoperative atrial fibrillation were associated with increased length of hospitalization and a higher risk of low cardiac output syndrome and pulmonary complications. On univariate analysis, significant risk factors associated with postoperative atrial fibrillation were E/e\' ratio, left atrial volume index (LAVi), GLST2 and ΔGLS%. On multivariable analysis, GLST2 (odds ratio: 1.21; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.06-1.56, P = 0.031) and ΔGLS% (odds ratio: 3.66; 95% CI: 1.85-6.79, P = 0.001) were independent predictors of postoperative atrial fibrillation.

The type of procedure, perioperative antiplatelet therapy, and other patient-related factors influence the risk of postoperative haemorrhage. Our objective was to analyze the postoperative risk factors for hemorrhagic complications and to determine the impact of antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy strategies on postoperative bleeding risk in patients with coronary stents undergoing non-cardiac surgery.\r\nPATIENTS AND METHODS:\r\nProspective, multicentre observational cohort study of 1134 consecutive patients with coronary stents undergoing non-cardiac surgery between April 2007 and April 2009. The primary outcome measure was the occurrence of an hemorrhagic complication during the first 30days following the surgery or intervention.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nAmong the 1134 patients evaluated, 108 (9.5%) experienced a postoperative hemorrhagic complication (with a median time to occurrence of 5.3days). These complications were considered major, involved the operative site, and required reoperation in 92 (85.2%), 92 (85.2%), and 20 (18.5%) of patients, respectively. Mortality in patients with a haemorrhagic complication was 12% (n=13). Independent postoperative factors associated with haemorrhagic complications were identified as a high and intermediate bleeding risk procedure and the use and dose of anticoagulants. When interrupted before the procedure, resumption of antiplatelet treatment was delayed in patients developing early postoperative hemorrhagic complications.\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\nPatients with coronary stents who undergo surgery are at high risk for hemorrhagic complications.','2014','May','15','2014-06-24 19:16:42',NULL,1,1),(8,1,'nick@masomurray.com','24908593','1873-4529','Journal of clinical anesthesia','Anesthetic management and outcomes for patients with pulmonary hypertension and intracardiac shunts and Eisenmenger syndrome: a review of institutional experience.','Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Significant systemic arterial hypotension occurred in 14 individuals (26%) and oxygen desaturation in 9 (17%) patients. Administration of an intravenous (IV) vasopressor agent during induction significantly decreased the incidence of hypotension. The type of IV induction agent did not influence hemodynamic alterations, though patients who received propofol experienced a trend towards increased hypotension (83% of pts) when a vasopressor was not used. Inhalational induction, regardless of vasopressor use, was more likely to result in hypotension (60% of pts). The 30-day mortality was 3.8% (two pts). Both patients had minor elective procedures with monitored anesthesia care (MAC).\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\nHypotension is more common in patients with Eisenmenger syndrome and similar physiology when a vasopressor is not used during the peri-induction period, regardless of induction agent. Etomidate tended to have better hemodynamic stability than other induction agents. The use of a vasopressor is recommended. We present general recommendations for anesthesiologists and strongly recommend use of a vasopressor before or during induction to reduce hypotension along with complete avoidance of inhalational induction. Further, MAC anesthesia has been associated with perioperative and 30-day mortality.','2014','Jun','4','2014-06-24 19:16:42',NULL,1,1),(9,1,'nick@masomurray.com','24906370','2047-9980','Journal of the American Heart Association','Assessment of a university of california, los angeles 4-variable risk score for advanced heart failure.','© 2014 The Authors.

The outcome was survival free from urgent transplantation or LVAD. The model-predicted survival was compared to Kaplan-Meier\'s estimated survival at 1, 2, and 3 years. Model discrimination and calibration were assessed. During a mean follow-up of 2.1 years, 37 (21%) events occurred. One-, 2- and 3-year observed event-free survival was 88%, 81%, and 75%, and the observed/predicted ratio was 0.97, 0.96, and 0.97, respectively. Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curve analyses demonstrated good discrimination overall (1-year area under curve, 0.801; 2-year, 0.774; 3-year, 0.837), but discrimination between the 2 highest risk groups was poor. The difference between observed and predicted survival ranged from -14 to +17 percentage points, suggesting poor model calibration. Fairly similar results were found when the analyses were repeated in 715 patients after multivariate imputation of missing data.\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\nThe UCLA 4-variable risk model calibration was inconsistent and high-risk discrimination was poor in an external validation cohort.

While donor identity of DNA extracted directly from blood collected in standard tubes containing anticoagulants can be easily verified by generating STR profiles, RNA from blood collected in PAXgene Blood RNA tubes (PAXgene RNA tubes) is depleted of DNA and is not amenable to STR fingerprinting for donor identity verification. We investigated the feasibility of isolating DNA directly from blood collected in PAXgene RNA tubes for use as template for STR DNA fingerprinting for blood donor identity verification. We determined that DNA extraction can be performed manually with the QIAamp DNA Blood Minikit or on the QIAxtractor instrument with minimal pre-processing protocol additions, and that DNA isolated from blood collected in PAXgene RNA tubes is of sufficient quantity and quality for successful STR fingerprint analysis.

If patient is suffering from diabetes, the incidence of cognitive dysfunction greatly increased. We therefore aimed to investigate the effects of isoflurane anesthesia on cognitive dysfunction in a diabetic rat model induced by a single injection of streptozotocin (STZ). Wistar rats received 2 h of 2% isoflurane or oxygen exposure 1 month after a single intraperitoneal injection of 60 mg/kg of STZ or the vehicle.

In addition to the expression of amyloid-β (Aβ), superoxide dismutase (SOD), malonyldialdehyde (MDA), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β), isoflurane anesthesia significantly increased as compared with a single injection of STZ.

Simple rotation of the catheter, echocardiography-guided placement to the centre of the ventricle, or ventricular expansion through crystalloid infusion may correct for these artifacts. Fluid administration, however, alters left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and volume and therefore stroke volume, thereby obscuring continuous real-time haemodynamic measurements.\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\nPressure-volume artifacts during inotropic infusion are caused by physical contact of the catheter with endocardium.

Myocardial infarction and stroke have been detected essentially in the early phase of the disease, i.e. within 48 hours from hospital admission, with an incidence ranging from as low as 1% to as high as 11%. Age, previous cardiovascular events and high pneumonia severity index were independent predictors of myocardial infarction; clinical predictors of stroke were not identified. Deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism may also occur after pneumonia but incidence and clinical predictors must be defined. Biological plausibility of such association may be deduced by experimental and clinical studies, showing that lung infection is complicated by platelet aggregation and clotting system activation, as documented by up-regulation of Tissue Factor and down-regulation of activated Protein C. The effect of antithrombotic drugs have been examined in experimental and clinical studies but results are still inconclusive. Thrombotic-related vascular disease such as myocardial infarction, stroke and venous thrombosis may complicate the clinical course of pneumonia and worsen its prognosis. Further definition of predictors may help to identify patients at higher risk of artery and venous thrombosis. Patients with pneumonia could benefit from antithrombotic strategy including anticoagulants and/or antiplatelet drugs but this should be tested in randomized clinical studies.

Recently, much attention has been paid to the PRFT dose and intra-operative parameters. It has been reported that high-voltage PRFT could significantly reduce discogenic pain. However, there is no study investigating the effects of high-voltage PRFT on TN. The aim of this prospective, randomized, double-blinded study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of high-voltage PRFT in comparison with standard-voltage PRFT for idiopathic TN. Sixty severe TN patients were randomly assigned to 2 groups treated with CT-guided standard- or high-voltage-pulsed radiofrequency (RF) of Gasserian ganglion, respectively, between January 2012 and July 2012. Numeric Rating Scales (NRS), carbamazepine dose, and side effects were evaluated at day 1, weeks 1 and 2, months 1, 3, and 6, and 1 year postoperative. There were 27 patients in the standard-voltage group and 26 patients in the high-voltage group who completed the 1-year follow-up study. The effective rates in the standard-voltage and high-voltage PRFT groups were 41% and 69%, respectively, at 1, 3, and 6 months postoperative (P = 0.037). The effective rate in the standard-voltage group decreased to 19% at 1-year postoperative, while in the high-voltage group remained at 69% (P = 0.000). No significant side effects were detected in both groups. In conclusion, CT-guided high-voltage PRFT is an effective and safe interventional therapeutic choice for idiopathic TN patients.','2014','Jun','23','2014-06-24 19:16:46',NULL,1,1),(39,2,'nickm@masomurray.com','24953986','1095-8673','The Journal of surgical research','Pivotal role of mast cell carboxypeptidase A in mediating protection against small intestinal ischemia-reperfusion injury in rats after ischemic preconditioning.','Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.','\r\nAIM OF THE STUDY:\r\nMast cell (MC) degranulation contributes to the protection mediated by ischemic preconditioning (IPC); however, the precise mechanisms underlying this protection remain largely unknown. Mast cell carboxypeptidase A (MC-CPA) is released solely from MCs and plays a critical role in degrading toxins and endothelin 1 (ET-1). The present study sought to explore whether MC-CPA is involved in the process of IPC in a rodent model of small intestinal ischemia reperfusion (IIR) injury.\r\nMATERIALS AND METHODS:\r\nIIR injuries were induced in Sprague-Dawley rats by clamping the superior mesenteric artery for 60 min followed by reperfusion for 2 h. One cycle of 10 min intestinal ischemia and 10 min of reperfusion was used in the IPC group, and the MC stabilizer cromolyn sodium and MC potato carboxypeptidase inhibitor were administered before the start of IPC. At the end of experiment, intestine tissue was obtained for assays of the MC-CPA3, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, and ET-1 contents and myeloperoxidase activities. Intestinal histologic injury scores and MC degranulation were assessed. Apoptosis indices and cleaved caspase- 3 protein expressions were quantified.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nIIR resulted in severe injury, as evidenced by significant increases in injury scores and MC-CPA3, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, and ET-1 contents that were accompanied with concomitant elevations in cleaved caspase 3 expression, apoptosis indices, and myeloperoxidase activities. IPC induced a significant increase in MC-CPA3, induced MC degranulation, and attenuated IIR injury by downregulating IIR-induced biochemical changes, whereas cromolyn sodium and potato carboxypeptidase inhibitor abolished the IPC-mediated changes.\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\nThese data suggest that IPC protected against IIR injury via the MC degranulation-mediated release of MC-CPA.','2014','May','23','2014-06-24 19:16:46',NULL,1,1),(40,2,'nickm@masomurray.com','24953890','1523-6838','American journal of kidney diseases : the official journal of the National Kidney Foundation','Serum Bicarbonate Concentrations and Kidney Disease Progression in Community-Living Elders: The Health, Aging, and Body Composition (Health ABC) Study.','Published by Elsevier Inc.','\r\nBACKGROUND:\r\nIn populations with prevalent chronic kidney disease (CKD), lower serum bicarbonate levels are associated with more rapid CKD progression, but whether lower bicarbonate levels also are associated with risk of incident estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)\r\nSTUDY DESIGN:\r\nLongitudinal observational cohort study.\r\nSETTING & PARTICIPANTS:\r\nWell-functioning community-living elders aged 70-79 years at inception.\r\nPREDICTOR:\r\nSerum bicarbonate level measured at the time of collection by arterialized venous blood sample using an arterial blood gas analyzer.\r\nOUTCOMES:\r\nChange in eGFR over 7 years, and new eGFR\r\nMEASUREMENTS:\r\nLinear and logistic regressions were used to evaluate associations of baseline serum bicarbonate level with change in eGFR and incident eGFR\r\nRESULTS:\r\nAt baseline, mean eGFR was 84±16 (SD)mL/min/1.73m(2), and serum bicarbonate level was 25.2±1.9mmol/L.

The in vivo role of FoxO1 in the regulation of cardiac NaV1.5 expression remains unknown. The present study aimed to define the role of FoxO1 in the regulation of NaV1.5 expression and cardiac Na(+) channel activity in mouse ventricular cardiomyocytes and assess the cardiac electrophysiological phenotype of mice with cardiac FoxO1 deletion. Tamoxifen-induced and cardiac-specific FoxO1 deletion was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Cardiac FoxO1 deletion failed to result in either cardiac functional changes or hypertrophy as assessed by echocardiography and individual ventricular cell capacitances, respectively. Western blotting showed that FoxO1 was significantly decreased while NaV1.5 protein level was significantly increased in mouse hearts with FoxO1 deletion. Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) revealed that FoxO1 deletion led to an increase in NaV1.5 and Na(+) channel subunit β3 mRNA, but not β1, 2, 4, or connexin 43. Whole patch-clamp recordings demonstrated that cardiac Na(+) currents were significantly augmented by FoxO1 deletion without affecting the steady-state activation and inactivation, leading to accelerated depolarization of action potentials in mouse ventricular cardiomyocytes. Electrocardiogram recordings showed that the QRS complex was significantly shortened and P wave amplitude was significantly increased in conscious and unrestrained mice with cardiac FoxO1 deletion. NaV1.5 expression was decreased in the peri-infarct (border-zone) of mice with myocardial infarction and FoxO1 accumulated in the cardiomyocyte nuclei of chronic ischemic human hearts. Our findings indicate that FoxO1 plays an important role in the regulation of NaV1.5 and β3 subunit expression as well as Na(+) channel activity in the heart and that FoxO1 is involved in the modulation of NaV1.5 expression in ischemic heart disease.','2014','Jun','20','2014-06-24 19:16:50',NULL,1,1),(42,3,'blindmurray@gmail.com','24955355','2314-6141','BioMed research international','Recombinant Human Factor IX Produced from Transgenic Porcine Milk.','','Production of biopharmaceuticals from transgenic animal milk is a cost-effective method for highly complex proteins that cannot be efficiently produced using conventional systems such as microorganisms or animal cells.

The purpose of this work was to test the possibility that the facilitation of lordosis behavior in estrogen-primed rats by progesterone (P) and its 5α- and 5β-reduced metabolites, gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH), leptin, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and vagino-cervical stimulation (VCS) involves interactions with classical ERs by using the selective ER modulator, tamoxifen. To further assess the role of ERs, we also explored the effects of the pure ER antagonist, ICI182780 (ICI), on estrous behavior induced by P and GnRH. Ovariectomized, estrogen-primed rats (5 μg estradiol benzoate 40 hr earlier) were injected intraventricularly with the above-mentioned compounds, or they received VCS. All compounds and VCS effectively facilitated estrous behavior when tested at 60, 120 or 240 min after infusion or application of VCS. Intraventricular infusion of tamoxifen (5 μg), 30 min prior, significantly attenuated estrous behaviors induced in estradiol-primed rats by P, most of its 5α- and 5β-reduced metabolites, GnRH, and PGE2, but not by VCS. Although there was a trend for reduction, tamoxifen did not significantly decrease lordosis in females treated with 5β-pregnan-3,20-dione. ICI also inhibited lordosis behavior induced by P and GnRH at some testing intervals. These results suggest that activation of classical ERs participates in the triggering effects on estrous behavior induced by agents with different chemical structures that do not bind directly to ERs.','2014','Jun','19','2014-06-24 19:16:50',NULL,1,1),(46,3,'blindmurray@gmail.com','24954165','1872-6623','Pain','Differential changes in functional disability and pain intensity over the course of psychological treatment for children with chronic pain.','Copyright © 2014.

Twenty-milliliter portions of red blood cells (RBCs) were added and processed under various conditions, including clinically relevant first filling and intermittent emptying. RBC recovery and availability and plasma elimination were calculated from the Hct, free hemoglobin, and total protein.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nThe main impediment to recovery and availability was the first filling. There, RBC recovery was significantly reduced, while it subsequently varied between 93 and 98%. To produce the first 30 mL of RBCs, ELECTA required 42 mL and C.A.T.S and OrthoPAT 62 mL owing to the dead space of the separation chamber or reservoir, respectively. RBC availability was much higher in subsequent processes, with only minimal differences between the three devices. They all consistently provided high plasma elimination rates.\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\nThe continuous system showed no advantage over a small Latham bowl.

Human embryonic stem cells are capable of differentiating into any cell type and represent a promising model to study mechanisms governing anesthetic-induced neurotoxicity.\r\nMETHODS::\r\nCell death in human embryonic stem cell-derived neurons was assessed using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate in situ nick end labeling staining, and microRNA expression was assessed using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. miR-21 was overexpressed and knocked down using an miR-21 mimic and antagomir, respectively. Sprouty 2 was knocked down using a small interfering RNA, and the expression of the miR-21 targets of interest was assessed by Western blot.\r\nRESULTS::\r\nPropofol dose and exposure time dependently induced significant cell death (n = 3) in the neurons and down-regulated several microRNAs, including miR-21. Overexpression of miR-21 and knockdown of Sprouty 2 attenuated the increase in terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate in situ nick end labeling-positive cells following propofol exposure. In addition, miR-21 knockdown increased the number of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate in situ nick end labeling-positive cells by 30% (n = 5). Finally, activated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 and protein kinase B (Akt) were down-regulated, and Sprouty 2 was up-regulated following propofol exposure (n = 3).\r\nCONCLUSIONS::\r\nThese data suggest that (1) human embryonic stem cell-derived neurons represent a promising in vitro human model for studying anesthetic-induced neurotoxicity, (2) propofol induces cell death in human embryonic stem cell-derived neurons, and (3) the propofol-induced cell death may occur via a signal transducer and activator of transcription 3/miR-21/Sprouty 2-dependent mechanism.','2014','Jun','19','2014-06-24 19:16:50',NULL,1,1),(55,3,'blindmurray@gmail.com','24949934','1878-5867','Steroids','The evolution of nonsteroidal antiestrogens to become selective estrogen receptor modulators.','Copyright © 2014.

Therefore, the diagnosis can be missed until complications such as perforation or hemorrhage occur. Few reports have investigated the procedures and outcomes of children who have undergone operations for perforated duodenal ulcers. We report our experience with the modified Graham technique for perforated duodenal ulcers in nine children and review the literature. Methods : The records of patients operated on for a perforated duodenal ulcer in the last 8 years in two pediatric surgery centers were evaluated retrospectively. Patient demographics, symptoms, time to admission to hospital, operative findings, and postoperative clinical course were evaluated. Results : Nine children (mean age 13.2 years, range 6-170 years) were included. All patients were admitted in the first six hours after their abdominal pain started. In three patients, there was free air on plain x-rays, while the x-rays were normal in six. All perforations were located on the anterior surface of the first part of the duodenum and repaired with primary suturing and Graham patch omentoplasty. The recovery was uneventful in all patients. In five patients, urea breath tests were performed postoperatively for Helicobacter Pylori, and the results were positive. All patients underwent triple therapy with lansoprazole, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin. The mean follow-up time was 58 (range 3-94) months. Conclusions : Peptic ulcer perforation should be suspected in children who have acute abdominal pain and peritoneal signs, especially when their suffering is intense. The simple patch repair and postoperative triple therapy for Helicobacter Pylori are safe and satisfactory for treating peptic ulcer perforation in children.','2014','May','','2014-06-24 19:16:50',NULL,1,1),(58,3,'blindmurray@gmail.com','24947930','1078-0432','Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research','Acquired resistance to endocrine treatments is associated to tumor-specific molecular changes in patient-derived luminal breast cancer xenografts.','Copyright © 2014, American Association for Cancer Research.','Purpose: patients with luminal breast cancer (LBC) often become endocrine-resistant over time. We investigated the molecular changes associated with acquired hormono-resistances in patient-derived xenografts of LBC. Experimental design: Two LBC xenografts (HBCx22 and HBCx34) were treated with different endocrine therapies (ET) to obtain xenografts with acquired resistances to tamoxifen (TamR) and ovariectomy (OvaR). PI3K pathway activation was analyzed by western blot and immunohistochemistry and responses to ET combined to everolimus were investigated in vivo. Gene expression analyses were performed by RT-PCR and Affymetrix arrays. Results: HBCx22 TamR xenograft was cross-resistant to several hormono-therapies, while HBCx22 OvaR and HBCx34 TamR exhibited a treatment specific resistance profile. PI3K pathway was similarly activated in parental and resistant xenografts but the addition of everolimus didn\'t restore the response to tamoxifen in TamR xenografts. By contrast, the combination of fulvestrant and everolimus induced tumor regression in vivo in HBCx34 TamR, where we found a cross-talk between ER and PI3K pathways. Expression of several ER-controlled genes and ER co-regulators was significantly changed in both TamR and OvaR tumors, indicating impaired ER transcriptional activity. Expression changes associated with hormono-resistance were both tumor and treatment specific and were enriched for genes involved in cell growth, cell death and cell survival. Conclusions: PDX models of LBC with acquired resistance to endocrine therapies show a great diversity of resistance phenotype, associated to specific deregulations of ER-mediated gene transcription. These models offer a tool for developing anticancer therapies and to investigate the dynamics of resistance emerging during pharmacological interventions.','2014','Jun','19','2014-06-24 19:16:50',NULL,1,1),(59,3,'blindmurray@gmail.com','24947863','1439-0531','Reproduction in domestic animals = Zuchthygiene','Causes, diagnosis and therapy of common diseases in neonatal puppies in the first days of life: cornerstones of practical approach.','© 2014 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.','Neonatal diseases and losses are a common and often unavoidable problem within breeding kennels. Altogether, morbidity and mortality ranges, according to the literature, from 5 to 35%. Among non-infectious causes besides hypoxia during birth, hypothermia, hypoglycaemia and dehydration are mostly responsible for puppy diseases and losses. Approximately 90% of all deaths in hypoxaemic pups occur during the first 2 days. Of 183 pups with hypoxia, 63 died, 92.7% of them within 48 h after birth. Among infectious causes, bacterial infection is the most common cause of neonatal mortality. Escherichia coli, streptococci, staphylococci, Pseudomonas sp., Klebsiella sp., Enterobacter sp. and some other micro-organisms are regularly involved in neonatal infections. Post-mortem findings especially document E. coli, Staphylococcus sp. and Streptococcus sp. as responsible bacteria. The dam and the environment are suspected as sources of neonatal infections as it was shown by genetic relatedness of responsible bacterial strains isolated in both puppies and their dams. From a total of 517 puppies with bacterial infections, the treatment results documented that parenteral administration of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid in 308 neonates showed the best result. Diagnosis of diseases is often made difficult by the absence of variability in clinical signs contrary to adult dogs. Findings during a physical examination in pups differ from those in adults.

The pathophysiology remains unclear, although evidence exists that surgical trauma and the use of cardiopulmonary bypass provoke an immune response leading to PPS. We hypothesized that an intraoperative dose of dexamethasone decreases the risk of PPS, by reducing this inflammatory response.\r\nMETHODS:\r\nWe performed a subanalysis of the DECS study, which is a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial of 4,494 patients undergoing cardiac surgery with use of cardiopulmonary bypass. The aim of the DECS study was to investigate whether a single intraoperative dose of 1 mg/kg dexamethasone reduced the incidence of a composite of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, renal failure, or respiratory failure, within 30 days of randomization. In this substudy, we retrospectively analyzed the occurrence of PPS in 822 patients who were included in the DECS trial and underwent valvular surgery. Postpericardiotomy syndrome was diagnosed if 2 of 5 listed symptoms were present: unexplained fever, pleuritic chest pain, pericardial or pleural rub, new or worsening pericardial or pleural effusion. All medical charts, x-rays, and echocardiograms were reviewed. Secondary end point was the occurrence of complicated PPS, defined as PPS with need for evacuation of pleural effusion, pericardiocentesis, and tamponade requiring intervention or hospital readmission for PPS. This is a blinded, single-center, post hoc analysis.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nPostpericardiotomy syndrome occurred in 119 patients (14.5%). The incidence of PPS after dexamethasone compared with placebo was 13.5% vs 15.5% (relative risk 0.88, 95% CI 0.63-1.22).

Fibulin-6, an ECM protein is expressed in cell junctions particularly in tissues subjected to significant mechanical stress. Fibulin-6 deficiency results in defective cell migration in nematodes and early embryonic lethality in mice. The role of fibulin-6 in healthy and failing myocardium has not been described. We have examined the expression and distribution pattern of fibulin-6 during myocardial remodeling (MR) and detailed its effect on the migratory function of cardiac fibroblasts (CF) in response to TGF-β1.\r\nMETHODS AND RESULTS:\r\nIn healthy murine myocardium fibulin-6 expression is largely confined to larger coronary arteries. It is induced during the early and the late phase of remodeling after infarction in murine hearts predominantly in the scar-muscle junction. Similar results are obtained in human ischemic cardiomyopathy. Fibulin-6 is mostly expressed in close vicinity to vimentin positive cells and is also abundantly expressed in vitro in cultured neonatal CF. TGF-β1 does not induce smooth muscle actin in fibroblasts deficient of fibulin-6, which also compromised their migration. Cells that had migrated expressed more fibulin-6 compared to stationary cells. Plated on fibulin-6 depleted matrix, stress fiber induction in fibroblast in response to TGF-β1 was impaired. In ex vivo explant cultures from postinfarct myocardium, the number of emigrating fibroblasts was also significantly reduced by fibulin-6 siRNA knock down (KD).\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\nFibulin-6, a fibroblast released ECM protein may play an important role during myocardial remodeling by imparting an effect on cardiac fibroblast migration in close and complementary interplay with TGF-β1 signalling.','2014','Jun','20','2014-06-24 20:14:19',NULL,1,1),(63,1,'nick@masomurray.com','24948576','1569-9285','Interactive cardiovascular and thoracic surgery','Computational fluid dynamics of the right ventricular outflow tract and of the pulmonary artery: a bench model of flow dynamics.','© The Author 2014.

The reoperation rate at 5 years can be as high as 25% and depends on age, type of conduit, conduit diameter and principal heart malformation. The aim of this study is to provide a bench model with computer fluid dynamics to analyse the haemodynamics of the RVOT, pulmonary artery, its bifurcation, and left and right pulmonary arteries that in the future may serve as a tool for analysis and prediction of outcome following RVOT reconstruction.\r\nMETHODS:\r\nPressure, flow and diameter at the RVOT, pulmonary artery, bifurcation of the pulmonary artery, and left and right pulmonary arteries were measured in five normal pigs with a mean weight of 24.6 ± 0.89 kg. Data obtained were used for a 3D computer fluid-dynamics simulation of flow conditions, focusing on the pressure, flow and shear stress profile of the pulmonary trunk to the level of the left and right pulmonary arteries.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nThree inlet steady flow profiles were obtained at 0.2, 0.29 and 0.36 m/s that correspond to the flow rates of 1.5, 2.0 and 2.5 l/min flow at the RVOT. The flow velocity profile was constant at the RVOT down to the bifurcation and decreased at the left and right pulmonary arteries. In all three inlet velocity profiles, low sheer stress and low-velocity areas were detected along the left wall of the pulmonary artery, at the pulmonary artery bifurcation and at the ostia of both pulmonary arteries.\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\nThis computed fluid real-time model provides us with a realistic picture of fluid dynamics in the pulmonary tract area. Deep shear stress areas correspond to a turbulent flow profile that is a predictive factor for the development of vessel wall arteriosclerosis.

The type of procedure, perioperative antiplatelet therapy, and other patient-related factors influence the risk of postoperative haemorrhage. Our objective was to analyze the postoperative risk factors for hemorrhagic complications and to determine the impact of antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy strategies on postoperative bleeding risk in patients with coronary stents undergoing non-cardiac surgery.\r\nPATIENTS AND METHODS:\r\nProspective, multicentre observational cohort study of 1134 consecutive patients with coronary stents undergoing non-cardiac surgery between April 2007 and April 2009. The primary outcome measure was the occurrence of an hemorrhagic complication during the first 30days following the surgery or intervention.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nAmong the 1134 patients evaluated, 108 (9.5%) experienced a postoperative hemorrhagic complication (with a median time to occurrence of 5.3days).

Mortality in patients with a haemorrhagic complication was 12% (n=13). Independent postoperative factors associated with haemorrhagic complications were identified as a high and intermediate bleeding risk procedure and the use and dose of anticoagulants.

Significant systemic arterial hypotension occurred in 14 individuals (26%) and oxygen desaturation in 9 (17%) patients. Administration of an intravenous (IV) vasopressor agent during induction significantly decreased the incidence of hypotension. The type of IV induction agent did not influence hemodynamic alterations, though patients who received propofol experienced a trend towards increased hypotension (83% of pts) when a vasopressor was not used. Inhalational induction, regardless of vasopressor use, was more likely to result in hypotension (60% of pts). The 30-day mortality was 3.8% (two pts). Both patients had minor elective procedures with monitored anesthesia care (MAC).\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\nHypotension is more common in patients with Eisenmenger syndrome and similar physiology when a vasopressor is not used during the peri-induction period, regardless of induction agent. Etomidate tended to have better hemodynamic stability than other induction agents. The use of a vasopressor is recommended. We present general recommendations for anesthesiologists and strongly recommend use of a vasopressor before or during induction to reduce hypotension along with complete avoidance of inhalational induction.

Included patients were treated with 3 mg/kg of vernakalant over 10 min and, if unsuccessful, a second dose of 2 mg/kg. Blood pressure was measured continuously for 2 hours after treatment. Results. Of the 191 patients screened, 159 (83%) were excluded, most importantly due to hemodynamic instability (59%). Vernakalant was administered to 32 (17% of the screened) patients. Within 6 hours, 17 (53%) patients converted to sinus rhythm. Blood pressure did not decrease significantly 10, 30, 60, and 120 minutes after the vernakalant infusion.

The pathophysiology remains unclear, although evidence exists that surgical trauma and the use of cardiopulmonary bypass provoke an immune response leading to PPS. We hypothesized that an intraoperative dose of dexamethasone decreases the risk of PPS, by reducing this inflammatory response.\r\nMETHODS:\r\nWe performed a subanalysis of the DECS study, which is a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial of 4,494 patients undergoing cardiac surgery with use of cardiopulmonary bypass. The aim of the DECS study was to investigate whether a single intraoperative dose of 1 mg/kg dexamethasone reduced the incidence of a composite of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, renal failure, or respiratory failure, within 30 days of randomization. In this substudy, we retrospectively analyzed the occurrence of PPS in 822 patients who were included in the DECS trial and underwent valvular surgery. Postpericardiotomy syndrome was diagnosed if 2 of 5 listed symptoms were present: unexplained fever, pleuritic chest pain, pericardial or pleural rub, new or worsening pericardial or pleural effusion. All medical charts, x-rays, and echocardiograms were reviewed. Secondary end point was the occurrence of complicated PPS, defined as PPS with need for evacuation of pleural effusion, pericardiocentesis, and tamponade requiring intervention or hospital readmission for PPS. This is a blinded, single-center, post hoc analysis.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nPostpericardiotomy syndrome occurred in 119 patients (14.5%). The incidence of PPS after dexamethasone compared with placebo was 13.5% vs 15.5% (relative risk 0.88, 95% CI 0.63-1.22). For complicated PPS, the incidence was 3.8% versus 3.2% (relative risk 1.17, 95% CI 0.57-2.41, P = .66), respectively.\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\nIn patients undergoing valvular cardiac surgery, high-dose dexamethasone treatment had no protective effect on the occurrence of PPS or complicated PPS.','2014','Jul','','2014-06-24 20:15:18',NULL,1,1),(82,1,'nick@masomurray.com','24951538','1755-3245','Cardiovascular research','Expression of fibulin-6 in failing hearts and its role for cardiac fibroblast migration.','Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology.

For permissions please email: journals.permissions@oup.com.','\r\nAIMS:\r\nThe cardiac extracellular matrix (ECM) undergoes a dynamic transition following myocardial infarction. Fibulin-6, an ECM protein is expressed in cell junctions particularly in tissues subjected to significant mechanical stress. Fibulin-6 deficiency results in defective cell migration in nematodes and early embryonic lethality in mice. The role of fibulin-6 in healthy and failing myocardium has not been described. We have examined the expression and distribution pattern of fibulin-6 during myocardial remodeling (MR) and detailed its effect on the migratory function of cardiac fibroblasts (CF) in response to TGF-β1.\r\nMETHODS AND RESULTS:\r\nIn healthy murine myocardium fibulin-6 expression is largely confined to larger coronary arteries. It is induced during the early and the late phase of remodeling after infarction in murine hearts predominantly in the scar-muscle junction. Similar results are obtained in human ischemic cardiomyopathy. Fibulin-6 is mostly expressed in close vicinity to vimentin positive cells and is also abundantly expressed in vitro in cultured neonatal CF. TGF-β1 does not induce smooth muscle actin in fibroblasts deficient of fibulin-6, which also compromised their migration. Cells that had migrated expressed more fibulin-6 compared to stationary cells. Plated on fibulin-6 depleted matrix, stress fiber induction in fibroblast in response to TGF-β1 was impaired. In ex vivo explant cultures from postinfarct myocardium, the number of emigrating fibroblasts was also significantly reduced by fibulin-6 siRNA knock down (KD).\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\nFibulin-6, a fibroblast released ECM protein may play an important role during myocardial remodeling by imparting an effect on cardiac fibroblast migration in close and complementary interplay with TGF-β1 signalling.','2014','Jun','20','2014-06-24 20:15:18',NULL,1,1),(83,1,'nick@masomurray.com','24948576','1569-9285','Interactive cardiovascular and thoracic surgery','Computational fluid dynamics of the right ventricular outflow tract and of the pulmonary artery: a bench model of flow dynamics.','© The Author 2014.

The reoperation rate at 5 years can be as high as 25% and depends on age, type of conduit, conduit diameter and principal heart malformation. The aim of this study is to provide a bench model with computer fluid dynamics to analyse the haemodynamics of the RVOT, pulmonary artery, its bifurcation, and left and right pulmonary arteries that in the future may serve as a tool for analysis and prediction of outcome following RVOT reconstruction.\r\nMETHODS:\r\nPressure, flow and diameter at the RVOT, pulmonary artery, bifurcation of the pulmonary artery, and left and right pulmonary arteries were measured in five normal pigs with a mean weight of 24.6 ± 0.89 kg. Data obtained were used for a 3D computer fluid-dynamics simulation of flow conditions, focusing on the pressure, flow and shear stress profile of the pulmonary trunk to the level of the left and right pulmonary arteries.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nThree inlet steady flow profiles were obtained at 0.2, 0.29 and 0.36 m/s that correspond to the flow rates of 1.5, 2.0 and 2.5 l/min flow at the RVOT. The flow velocity profile was constant at the RVOT down to the bifurcation and decreased at the left and right pulmonary arteries. In all three inlet velocity profiles, low sheer stress and low-velocity areas were detected along the left wall of the pulmonary artery, at the pulmonary artery bifurcation and at the ostia of both pulmonary arteries.\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\nThis computed fluid real-time model provides us with a realistic picture of fluid dynamics in the pulmonary tract area. Deep shear stress areas correspond to a turbulent flow profile that is a predictive factor for the development of vessel wall arteriosclerosis. We believe that this bench model may be a useful tool for further evaluation of RVOT pathology following surgical reconstructions.','2014','Jun','19','2014-06-24 20:15:18',NULL,1,1),(84,1,'nick@masomurray.com','24937347','1526-7598','Anesthesia and analgesia','The Long-Term Impact of Early Cardiovascular Therapy Intensification for Postoperative Troponin Elevation after Major Vascular Surgery.','','\r\nBACKGROUND::\r\nAcute cardiac events are a frequent cause of morbidity after vascular surgery.

We then determined which of these patients received medical therapy as per the 2007 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association recommendations for the medical management of patients with chronic stable angina. All patients with troponin elevation were then matched with 2 control patients without postoperative troponin elevation. Matching was done using logistic regression and nearest-neighbor matching methods. The primary study end point was 12 months survival without a major cardiac event (i.e., death, myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, or pulmonary edema requiring hospitalization).\r\nRESULTS::\r\nTherapy was intensified in 43 of 66 patients (65%) who suffered a troponin I elevation after surgery.

Significant systemic arterial hypotension occurred in 14 individuals (26%) and oxygen desaturation in 9 (17%) patients. Administration of an intravenous (IV) vasopressor agent during induction significantly decreased the incidence of hypotension. The type of IV induction agent did not influence hemodynamic alterations, though patients who received propofol experienced a trend towards increased hypotension (83% of pts) when a vasopressor was not used. Inhalational induction, regardless of vasopressor use, was more likely to result in hypotension (60% of pts). The 30-day mortality was 3.8% (two pts). Both patients had minor elective procedures with monitored anesthesia care (MAC).\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\nHypotension is more common in patients with Eisenmenger syndrome and similar physiology when a vasopressor is not used during the peri-induction period, regardless of induction agent. Etomidate tended to have better hemodynamic stability than other induction agents. The use of a vasopressor is recommended. We present general recommendations for anesthesiologists and strongly recommend use of a vasopressor before or during induction to reduce hypotension along with complete avoidance of inhalational induction.

While donor identity of DNA extracted directly from blood collected in standard tubes containing anticoagulants can be easily verified by generating STR profiles, RNA from blood collected in PAXgene Blood RNA tubes (PAXgene RNA tubes) is depleted of DNA and is not amenable to STR fingerprinting for donor identity verification. We investigated the feasibility of isolating DNA directly from blood collected in PAXgene RNA tubes for use as template for STR DNA fingerprinting for blood donor identity verification. We determined that DNA extraction can be performed manually with the QIAamp DNA Blood Minikit or on the QIAxtractor instrument with minimal pre-processing protocol additions, and that DNA isolated from blood collected in PAXgene RNA tubes is of sufficient quantity and quality for successful STR fingerprint analysis.

Simple rotation of the catheter, echocardiography-guided placement to the centre of the ventricle, or ventricular expansion through crystalloid infusion may correct for these artifacts. Fluid administration, however, alters left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and volume and therefore stroke volume, thereby obscuring continuous real-time haemodynamic measurements.\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\nPressure-volume artifacts during inotropic infusion are caused by physical contact of the catheter with endocardium.

The effect of antithrombotic drugs have been examined in experimental and clinical studies but results are still inconclusive. Thrombotic-related vascular disease such as myocardial infarction, stroke and venous thrombosis may complicate the clinical course of pneumonia and worsen its prognosis.

All rights reserved.','\r\nAIM OF THE STUDY:\r\nMast cell (MC) degranulation contributes to the protection mediated by ischemic preconditioning (IPC); however, the precise mechanisms underlying this protection remain largely unknown. Mast cell carboxypeptidase A (MC-CPA) is released solely from MCs and plays a critical role in degrading toxins and endothelin 1 (ET-1). The present study sought to explore whether MC-CPA is involved in the process of IPC in a rodent model of small intestinal ischemia reperfusion (IIR) injury.\r\nMATERIALS AND METHODS:\r\nIIR injuries were induced in Sprague-Dawley rats by clamping the superior mesenteric artery for 60 min followed by reperfusion for 2 h. One cycle of 10 min intestinal ischemia and 10 min of reperfusion was used in the IPC group, and the MC stabilizer cromolyn sodium and MC potato carboxypeptidase inhibitor were administered before the start of IPC. At the end of experiment, intestine tissue was obtained for assays of the MC-CPA3, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, and ET-1 contents and myeloperoxidase activities. Intestinal histologic injury scores and MC degranulation were assessed. Apoptosis indices and cleaved caspase- 3 protein expressions were quantified.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nIIR resulted in severe injury, as evidenced by significant increases in injury scores and MC-CPA3, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, and ET-1 contents that were accompanied with concomitant elevations in cleaved caspase 3 expression, apoptosis indices, and myeloperoxidase activities. IPC induced a significant increase in MC-CPA3, induced MC degranulation, and attenuated IIR injury by downregulating IIR-induced biochemical changes, whereas cromolyn sodium and potato carboxypeptidase inhibitor abolished the IPC-mediated changes.\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\nThese data suggest that IPC protected against IIR injury via the MC degranulation-mediated release of MC-CPA.','2014','May','23','2014-06-24 20:15:23',NULL,1,1),(120,2,'nickm@masomurray.com','24953890','1523-6838','American journal of kidney diseases : the official journal of the National Kidney Foundation','Serum Bicarbonate Concentrations and Kidney Disease Progression in Community-Living Elders: The Health, Aging, and Body Composition (Health ABC) Study.','Published by Elsevier Inc.','\r\nBACKGROUND:\r\nIn populations with prevalent chronic kidney disease (CKD), lower serum bicarbonate levels are associated with more rapid CKD progression, but whether lower bicarbonate levels also are associated with risk of incident estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)\r\nSTUDY DESIGN:\r\nLongitudinal observational cohort study.\r\nSETTING & PARTICIPANTS:\r\nWell-functioning community-living elders aged 70-79 years at inception.\r\nPREDICTOR:\r\nSerum bicarbonate level measured at the time of collection by arterialized venous blood sample using an arterial blood gas analyzer.\r\nOUTCOMES:\r\nChange in eGFR over 7 years, and new eGFR\r\nMEASUREMENTS:\r\nLinear and logistic regressions were used to evaluate associations of baseline serum bicarbonate level with change in eGFR and incident eGFR\r\nRESULTS:\r\nAt baseline, mean eGFR was 84±16 (SD)mL/min/1.73m(2), and serum bicarbonate level was 25.2±1.9mmol/L.

The in vivo role of FoxO1 in the regulation of cardiac NaV1.5 expression remains unknown. The present study aimed to define the role of FoxO1 in the regulation of NaV1.5 expression and cardiac Na(+) channel activity in mouse ventricular cardiomyocytes and assess the cardiac electrophysiological phenotype of mice with cardiac FoxO1 deletion. Tamoxifen-induced and cardiac-specific FoxO1 deletion was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Cardiac FoxO1 deletion failed to result in either cardiac functional changes or hypertrophy as assessed by echocardiography and individual ventricular cell capacitances, respectively. Western blotting showed that FoxO1 was significantly decreased while NaV1.5 protein level was significantly increased in mouse hearts with FoxO1 deletion. Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) revealed that FoxO1 deletion led to an increase in NaV1.5 and Na(+) channel subunit β3 mRNA, but not β1, 2, 4, or connexin 43. Whole patch-clamp recordings demonstrated that cardiac Na(+) currents were significantly augmented by FoxO1 deletion without affecting the steady-state activation and inactivation, leading to accelerated depolarization of action potentials in mouse ventricular cardiomyocytes. Electrocardiogram recordings showed that the QRS complex was significantly shortened and P wave amplitude was significantly increased in conscious and unrestrained mice with cardiac FoxO1 deletion. NaV1.5 expression was decreased in the peri-infarct (border-zone) of mice with myocardial infarction and FoxO1 accumulated in the cardiomyocyte nuclei of chronic ischemic human hearts. Our findings indicate that FoxO1 plays an important role in the regulation of NaV1.5 and β3 subunit expression as well as Na(+) channel activity in the heart and that FoxO1 is involved in the modulation of NaV1.5 expression in ischemic heart disease.','2014','Jun','20','2014-06-24 20:15:27',NULL,1,1),(122,3,'blindmurray@gmail.com','24955355','2314-6141','BioMed research international','Recombinant Human Factor IX Produced from Transgenic Porcine Milk.','','Production of biopharmaceuticals from transgenic animal milk is a cost-effective method for highly complex proteins that cannot be efficiently produced using conventional systems such as microorganisms or animal cells.

The purpose of this work was to test the possibility that the facilitation of lordosis behavior in estrogen-primed rats by progesterone (P) and its 5α- and 5β-reduced metabolites, gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH), leptin, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and vagino-cervical stimulation (VCS) involves interactions with classical ERs by using the selective ER modulator, tamoxifen. To further assess the role of ERs, we also explored the effects of the pure ER antagonist, ICI182780 (ICI), on estrous behavior induced by P and GnRH. Ovariectomized, estrogen-primed rats (5 μg estradiol benzoate 40 hr earlier) were injected intraventricularly with the above-mentioned compounds, or they received VCS. All compounds and VCS effectively facilitated estrous behavior when tested at 60, 120 or 240 min after infusion or application of VCS. Intraventricular infusion of tamoxifen (5 μg), 30 min prior, significantly attenuated estrous behaviors induced in estradiol-primed rats by P, most of its 5α- and 5β-reduced metabolites, GnRH, and PGE2, but not by VCS. Although there was a trend for reduction, tamoxifen did not significantly decrease lordosis in females treated with 5β-pregnan-3,20-dione.

Twenty-milliliter portions of red blood cells (RBCs) were added and processed under various conditions, including clinically relevant first filling and intermittent emptying. RBC recovery and availability and plasma elimination were calculated from the Hct, free hemoglobin, and total protein.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nThe main impediment to recovery and availability was the first filling. There, RBC recovery was significantly reduced, while it subsequently varied between 93 and 98%. To produce the first 30 mL of RBCs, ELECTA required 42 mL and C.A.T.S and OrthoPAT 62 mL owing to the dead space of the separation chamber or reservoir, respectively. RBC availability was much higher in subsequent processes, with only minimal differences between the three devices. They all consistently provided high plasma elimination rates.\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\nThe continuous system showed no advantage over a small Latham bowl.

Pre-menopausal women were allocated to radiotherapy (RT), RT+oral cyclophosphamide (RT+C) or cyclophosphamide only (C). Post-menopausal women were allocated to RT, RT+Tamoxifen for one year (RT+Tam) or tamoxifen only (Tam). Information on admission to hospital, mortality and causes of death was obtained from national registers.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nAfter 25years, adding RT to cyclophosphamide in pre-menopausal women raised the mortality from heart disease from zero to 0.8% (p=0.04). In post-menopausal women, adding RT to Tam raised the mortality from heart disease from 10.5% to 18.4% (p=0.005). In post-menopausal women mortality due to cerebrovascular disease increased from 3.4% to 8.7% by adding RT to Tam (p=0.015). The differences were not evident until in the second decade of follow-up.

These studies have raised significant safety concerns regarding the use of anesthetics in the pediatric population and highlight the need for a better model to study anesthetic-induced neurotoxicity in humans. Human embryonic stem cells are capable of differentiating into any cell type and represent a promising model to study mechanisms governing anesthetic-induced neurotoxicity.\r\nMETHODS::\r\nCell death in human embryonic stem cell-derived neurons was assessed using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate in situ nick end labeling staining, and microRNA expression was assessed using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. miR-21 was overexpressed and knocked down using an miR-21 mimic and antagomir, respectively. Sprouty 2 was knocked down using a small interfering RNA, and the expression of the miR-21 targets of interest was assessed by Western blot.\r\nRESULTS::\r\nPropofol dose and exposure time dependently induced significant cell death (n = 3) in the neurons and down-regulated several microRNAs, including miR-21. Overexpression of miR-21 and knockdown of Sprouty 2 attenuated the increase in terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate in situ nick end labeling-positive cells following propofol exposure. In addition, miR-21 knockdown increased the number of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate in situ nick end labeling-positive cells by 30% (n = 5). Finally, activated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 and protein kinase B (Akt) were down-regulated, and Sprouty 2 was up-regulated following propofol exposure (n = 3).\r\nCONCLUSIONS::\r\nThese data suggest that (1) human embryonic stem cell-derived neurons represent a promising in vitro human model for studying anesthetic-induced neurotoxicity, (2) propofol induces cell death in human embryonic stem cell-derived neurons, and (3) the propofol-induced cell death may occur via a signal transducer and activator of transcription 3/miR-21/Sprouty 2-dependent mechanism.','2014','Jun','19','2014-06-24 20:15:27',NULL,1,1),(135,3,'blindmurray@gmail.com','24949934','1878-5867','Steroids','The evolution of nonsteroidal antiestrogens to become selective estrogen receptor modulators.','Copyright © 2014.

Therefore, the diagnosis can be missed until complications such as perforation or hemorrhage occur. Few reports have investigated the procedures and outcomes of children who have undergone operations for perforated duodenal ulcers. We report our experience with the modified Graham technique for perforated duodenal ulcers in nine children and review the literature. Methods : The records of patients operated on for a perforated duodenal ulcer in the last 8 years in two pediatric surgery centers were evaluated retrospectively. Patient demographics, symptoms, time to admission to hospital, operative findings, and postoperative clinical course were evaluated. Results : Nine children (mean age 13.2 years, range 6-170 years) were included. All patients were admitted in the first six hours after their abdominal pain started. In three patients, there was free air on plain x-rays, while the x-rays were normal in six. All perforations were located on the anterior surface of the first part of the duodenum and repaired with primary suturing and Graham patch omentoplasty. The recovery was uneventful in all patients. In five patients, urea breath tests were performed postoperatively for Helicobacter Pylori, and the results were positive. All patients underwent triple therapy with lansoprazole, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin. The mean follow-up time was 58 (range 3-94) months. Conclusions : Peptic ulcer perforation should be suspected in children who have acute abdominal pain and peritoneal signs, especially when their suffering is intense. The simple patch repair and postoperative triple therapy for Helicobacter Pylori are safe and satisfactory for treating peptic ulcer perforation in children.','2014','May','','2014-06-24 20:15:27',NULL,1,1),(138,3,'blindmurray@gmail.com','24947930','1078-0432','Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research','Acquired resistance to endocrine treatments is associated to tumor-specific molecular changes in patient-derived luminal breast cancer xenografts.','Copyright © 2014, American Association for Cancer Research.','Purpose: patients with luminal breast cancer (LBC) often become endocrine-resistant over time. We investigated the molecular changes associated with acquired hormono-resistances in patient-derived xenografts of LBC. Experimental design: Two LBC xenografts (HBCx22 and HBCx34) were treated with different endocrine therapies (ET) to obtain xenografts with acquired resistances to tamoxifen (TamR) and ovariectomy (OvaR). PI3K pathway activation was analyzed by western blot and immunohistochemistry and responses to ET combined to everolimus were investigated in vivo. Gene expression analyses were performed by RT-PCR and Affymetrix arrays. Results: HBCx22 TamR xenograft was cross-resistant to several hormono-therapies, while HBCx22 OvaR and HBCx34 TamR exhibited a treatment specific resistance profile. PI3K pathway was similarly activated in parental and resistant xenografts but the addition of everolimus didn\'t restore the response to tamoxifen in TamR xenografts. By contrast, the combination of fulvestrant and everolimus induced tumor regression in vivo in HBCx34 TamR, where we found a cross-talk between ER and PI3K pathways. Expression of several ER-controlled genes and ER co-regulators was significantly changed in both TamR and OvaR tumors, indicating impaired ER transcriptional activity. Expression changes associated with hormono-resistance were both tumor and treatment specific and were enriched for genes involved in cell growth, cell death and cell survival. Conclusions: PDX models of LBC with acquired resistance to endocrine therapies show a great diversity of resistance phenotype, associated to specific deregulations of ER-mediated gene transcription. These models offer a tool for developing anticancer therapies and to investigate the dynamics of resistance emerging during pharmacological interventions.','2014','Jun','19','2014-06-24 20:15:27',NULL,1,1),(139,3,'blindmurray@gmail.com','24947863','1439-0531','Reproduction in domestic animals = Zuchthygiene','Causes, diagnosis and therapy of common diseases in neonatal puppies in the first days of life: cornerstones of practical approach.','© 2014 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.','Neonatal diseases and losses are a common and often unavoidable problem within breeding kennels. Altogether, morbidity and mortality ranges, according to the literature, from 5 to 35%. Among non-infectious causes besides hypoxia during birth, hypothermia, hypoglycaemia and dehydration are mostly responsible for puppy diseases and losses. Approximately 90% of all deaths in hypoxaemic pups occur during the first 2 days. Of 183 pups with hypoxia, 63 died, 92.7% of them within 48 h after birth. Among infectious causes, bacterial infection is the most common cause of neonatal mortality. Escherichia coli, streptococci, staphylococci, Pseudomonas sp., Klebsiella sp., Enterobacter sp. and some other micro-organisms are regularly involved in neonatal infections. Post-mortem findings especially document E. coli, Staphylococcus sp. and Streptococcus sp. as responsible bacteria. The dam and the environment are suspected as sources of neonatal infections as it was shown by genetic relatedness of responsible bacterial strains isolated in both puppies and their dams. From a total of 517 puppies with bacterial infections, the treatment results documented that parenteral administration of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid in 308 neonates showed the best result. Diagnosis of diseases is often made difficult by the absence of variability in clinical signs contrary to adult dogs. Findings during a physical examination in pups differ from those in adults.

The pathophysiology remains unclear, although evidence exists that surgical trauma and the use of cardiopulmonary bypass provoke an immune response leading to PPS. We hypothesized that an intraoperative dose of dexamethasone decreases the risk of PPS, by reducing this inflammatory response.\r\nMETHODS:\r\nWe performed a subanalysis of the DECS study, which is a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial of 4,494 patients undergoing cardiac surgery with use of cardiopulmonary bypass. The aim of the DECS study was to investigate whether a single intraoperative dose of 1 mg/kg dexamethasone reduced the incidence of a composite of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, renal failure, or respiratory failure, within 30 days of randomization. In this substudy, we retrospectively analyzed the occurrence of PPS in 822 patients who were included in the DECS trial and underwent valvular surgery. Postpericardiotomy syndrome was diagnosed if 2 of 5 listed symptoms were present: unexplained fever, pleuritic chest pain, pericardial or pleural rub, new or worsening pericardial or pleural effusion. All medical charts, x-rays, and echocardiograms were reviewed. Secondary end point was the occurrence of complicated PPS, defined as PPS with need for evacuation of pleural effusion, pericardiocentesis, and tamponade requiring intervention or hospital readmission for PPS. This is a blinded, single-center, post hoc analysis.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nPostpericardiotomy syndrome occurred in 119 patients (14.5%).

Fibulin-6, an ECM protein is expressed in cell junctions particularly in tissues subjected to significant mechanical stress. Fibulin-6 deficiency results in defective cell migration in nematodes and early embryonic lethality in mice. The role of fibulin-6 in healthy and failing myocardium has not been described. We have examined the expression and distribution pattern of fibulin-6 during myocardial remodeling (MR) and detailed its effect on the migratory function of cardiac fibroblasts (CF) in response to TGF-β1.\r\nMETHODS AND RESULTS:\r\nIn healthy murine myocardium fibulin-6 expression is largely confined to larger coronary arteries. It is induced during the early and the late phase of remodeling after infarction in murine hearts predominantly in the scar-muscle junction. Similar results are obtained in human ischemic cardiomyopathy. Fibulin-6 is mostly expressed in close vicinity to vimentin positive cells and is also abundantly expressed in vitro in cultured neonatal CF. TGF-β1 does not induce smooth muscle actin in fibroblasts deficient of fibulin-6, which also compromised their migration. Cells that had migrated expressed more fibulin-6 compared to stationary cells. Plated on fibulin-6 depleted matrix, stress fiber induction in fibroblast in response to TGF-β1 was impaired. In ex vivo explant cultures from postinfarct myocardium, the number of emigrating fibroblasts was also significantly reduced by fibulin-6 siRNA knock down (KD).\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\nFibulin-6, a fibroblast released ECM protein may play an important role during myocardial remodeling by imparting an effect on cardiac fibroblast migration in close and complementary interplay with TGF-β1 signalling.','2014','Jun','20','2014-06-24 20:18:40',NULL,1,1),(143,1,'nick@masomurray.com','24948576','1569-9285','Interactive cardiovascular and thoracic surgery','Computational fluid dynamics of the right ventricular outflow tract and of the pulmonary artery: a bench model of flow dynamics.','© The Author 2014.

The reoperation rate at 5 years can be as high as 25% and depends on age, type of conduit, conduit diameter and principal heart malformation. The aim of this study is to provide a bench model with computer fluid dynamics to analyse the haemodynamics of the RVOT, pulmonary artery, its bifurcation, and left and right pulmonary arteries that in the future may serve as a tool for analysis and prediction of outcome following RVOT reconstruction.\r\nMETHODS:\r\nPressure, flow and diameter at the RVOT, pulmonary artery, bifurcation of the pulmonary artery, and left and right pulmonary arteries were measured in five normal pigs with a mean weight of 24.6 ± 0.89 kg. Data obtained were used for a 3D computer fluid-dynamics simulation of flow conditions, focusing on the pressure, flow and shear stress profile of the pulmonary trunk to the level of the left and right pulmonary arteries.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nThree inlet steady flow profiles were obtained at 0.2, 0.29 and 0.36 m/s that correspond to the flow rates of 1.5, 2.0 and 2.5 l/min flow at the RVOT. The flow velocity profile was constant at the RVOT down to the bifurcation and decreased at the left and right pulmonary arteries. In all three inlet velocity profiles, low sheer stress and low-velocity areas were detected along the left wall of the pulmonary artery, at the pulmonary artery bifurcation and at the ostia of both pulmonary arteries.\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\nThis computed fluid real-time model provides us with a realistic picture of fluid dynamics in the pulmonary tract area. Deep shear stress areas correspond to a turbulent flow profile that is a predictive factor for the development of vessel wall arteriosclerosis.

The type of procedure, perioperative antiplatelet therapy, and other patient-related factors influence the risk of postoperative haemorrhage. Our objective was to analyze the postoperative risk factors for hemorrhagic complications and to determine the impact of antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy strategies on postoperative bleeding risk in patients with coronary stents undergoing non-cardiac surgery.\r\nPATIENTS AND METHODS:\r\nProspective, multicentre observational cohort study of 1134 consecutive patients with coronary stents undergoing non-cardiac surgery between April 2007 and April 2009. The primary outcome measure was the occurrence of an hemorrhagic complication during the first 30days following the surgery or intervention.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nAmong the 1134 patients evaluated, 108 (9.5%) experienced a postoperative hemorrhagic complication (with a median time to occurrence of 5.3days).

Mortality in patients with a haemorrhagic complication was 12% (n=13). Independent postoperative factors associated with haemorrhagic complications were identified as a high and intermediate bleeding risk procedure and the use and dose of anticoagulants.

Both patients had minor elective procedures with monitored anesthesia care (MAC).\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\nHypotension is more common in patients with Eisenmenger syndrome and similar physiology when a vasopressor is not used during the peri-induction period, regardless of induction agent. Etomidate tended to have better hemodynamic stability than other induction agents. The use of a vasopressor is recommended. We present general recommendations for anesthesiologists and strongly recommend use of a vasopressor before or during induction to reduce hypotension along with complete avoidance of inhalational induction. Further, MAC anesthesia has been associated with perioperative and 30-day mortality.','2014','Jun','4','2014-06-24 20:18:40',NULL,1,1),(149,1,'nick@masomurray.com','24906370','2047-9980','Journal of the American Heart Association','Assessment of a university of california, los angeles 4-variable risk score for advanced heart failure.','© 2014 The Authors.

The outcome was survival free from urgent transplantation or LVAD. The model-predicted survival was compared to Kaplan-Meier\'s estimated survival at 1, 2, and 3 years. Model discrimination and calibration were assessed. During a mean follow-up of 2.1 years, 37 (21%) events occurred. One-, 2- and 3-year observed event-free survival was 88%, 81%, and 75%, and the observed/predicted ratio was 0.97, 0.96, and 0.97, respectively. Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curve analyses demonstrated good discrimination overall (1-year area under curve, 0.801; 2-year, 0.774; 3-year, 0.837), but discrimination between the 2 highest risk groups was poor. The difference between observed and predicted survival ranged from -14 to +17 percentage points, suggesting poor model calibration. Fairly similar results were found when the analyses were repeated in 715 patients after multivariate imputation of missing data.\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\nThe UCLA 4-variable risk model calibration was inconsistent and high-risk discrimination was poor in an external validation cohort.

While donor identity of DNA extracted directly from blood collected in standard tubes containing anticoagulants can be easily verified by generating STR profiles, RNA from blood collected in PAXgene Blood RNA tubes (PAXgene RNA tubes) is depleted of DNA and is not amenable to STR fingerprinting for donor identity verification.

We determined that DNA extraction can be performed manually with the QIAamp DNA Blood Minikit or on the QIAxtractor instrument with minimal pre-processing protocol additions, and that DNA isolated from blood collected in PAXgene RNA tubes is of sufficient quantity and quality for successful STR fingerprint analysis.

We therefore aimed to investigate the effects of isoflurane anesthesia on cognitive dysfunction in a diabetic rat model induced by a single injection of streptozotocin (STZ).

Simple rotation of the catheter, echocardiography-guided placement to the centre of the ventricle, or ventricular expansion through crystalloid infusion may correct for these artifacts. Fluid administration, however, alters left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and volume and therefore stroke volume, thereby obscuring continuous real-time haemodynamic measurements.\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\nPressure-volume artifacts during inotropic infusion are caused by physical contact of the catheter with endocardium.

All rights reserved.','\r\nAIM OF THE STUDY:\r\nMast cell (MC) degranulation contributes to the protection mediated by ischemic preconditioning (IPC); however, the precise mechanisms underlying this protection remain largely unknown. Mast cell carboxypeptidase A (MC-CPA) is released solely from MCs and plays a critical role in degrading toxins and endothelin 1 (ET-1). The present study sought to explore whether MC-CPA is involved in the process of IPC in a rodent model of small intestinal ischemia reperfusion (IIR) injury.\r\nMATERIALS AND METHODS:\r\nIIR injuries were induced in Sprague-Dawley rats by clamping the superior mesenteric artery for 60 min followed by reperfusion for 2 h. One cycle of 10 min intestinal ischemia and 10 min of reperfusion was used in the IPC group, and the MC stabilizer cromolyn sodium and MC potato carboxypeptidase inhibitor were administered before the start of IPC. At the end of experiment, intestine tissue was obtained for assays of the MC-CPA3, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, and ET-1 contents and myeloperoxidase activities. Intestinal histologic injury scores and MC degranulation were assessed. Apoptosis indices and cleaved caspase- 3 protein expressions were quantified.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nIIR resulted in severe injury, as evidenced by significant increases in injury scores and MC-CPA3, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, and ET-1 contents that were accompanied with concomitant elevations in cleaved caspase 3 expression, apoptosis indices, and myeloperoxidase activities. IPC induced a significant increase in MC-CPA3, induced MC degranulation, and attenuated IIR injury by downregulating IIR-induced biochemical changes, whereas cromolyn sodium and potato carboxypeptidase inhibitor abolished the IPC-mediated changes.\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\nThese data suggest that IPC protected against IIR injury via the MC degranulation-mediated release of MC-CPA.','2014','May','23','2014-06-24 20:18:45',NULL,1,1),(180,2,'nickm@masomurray.com','24953890','1523-6838','American journal of kidney diseases : the official journal of the National Kidney Foundation','Serum Bicarbonate Concentrations and Kidney Disease Progression in Community-Living Elders: The Health, Aging, and Body Composition (Health ABC) Study.','Published by Elsevier Inc.','\r\nBACKGROUND:\r\nIn populations with prevalent chronic kidney disease (CKD), lower serum bicarbonate levels are associated with more rapid CKD progression, but whether lower bicarbonate levels also are associated with risk of incident estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)\r\nSTUDY DESIGN:\r\nLongitudinal observational cohort study.\r\nSETTING & PARTICIPANTS:\r\nWell-functioning community-living elders aged 70-79 years at inception.\r\nPREDICTOR:\r\nSerum bicarbonate level measured at the time of collection by arterialized venous blood sample using an arterial blood gas analyzer.\r\nOUTCOMES:\r\nChange in eGFR over 7 years, and new eGFR\r\nMEASUREMENTS:\r\nLinear and logistic regressions were used to evaluate associations of baseline serum bicarbonate level with change in eGFR and incident eGFR\r\nRESULTS:\r\nAt baseline, mean eGFR was 84±16 (SD)mL/min/1.73m(2), and serum bicarbonate level was 25.2±1.9mmol/L.

The in vivo role of FoxO1 in the regulation of cardiac NaV1.5 expression remains unknown. The present study aimed to define the role of FoxO1 in the regulation of NaV1.5 expression and cardiac Na(+) channel activity in mouse ventricular cardiomyocytes and assess the cardiac electrophysiological phenotype of mice with cardiac FoxO1 deletion. Tamoxifen-induced and cardiac-specific FoxO1 deletion was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Cardiac FoxO1 deletion failed to result in either cardiac functional changes or hypertrophy as assessed by echocardiography and individual ventricular cell capacitances, respectively. Western blotting showed that FoxO1 was significantly decreased while NaV1.5 protein level was significantly increased in mouse hearts with FoxO1 deletion. Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) revealed that FoxO1 deletion led to an increase in NaV1.5 and Na(+) channel subunit β3 mRNA, but not β1, 2, 4, or connexin 43. Whole patch-clamp recordings demonstrated that cardiac Na(+) currents were significantly augmented by FoxO1 deletion without affecting the steady-state activation and inactivation, leading to accelerated depolarization of action potentials in mouse ventricular cardiomyocytes. Electrocardiogram recordings showed that the QRS complex was significantly shortened and P wave amplitude was significantly increased in conscious and unrestrained mice with cardiac FoxO1 deletion. NaV1.5 expression was decreased in the peri-infarct (border-zone) of mice with myocardial infarction and FoxO1 accumulated in the cardiomyocyte nuclei of chronic ischemic human hearts. Our findings indicate that FoxO1 plays an important role in the regulation of NaV1.5 and β3 subunit expression as well as Na(+) channel activity in the heart and that FoxO1 is involved in the modulation of NaV1.5 expression in ischemic heart disease.','2014','Jun','20','2014-06-24 20:18:48',NULL,1,1),(182,3,'blindmurray@gmail.com','24955355','2314-6141','BioMed research international','Recombinant Human Factor IX Produced from Transgenic Porcine Milk.','','Production of biopharmaceuticals from transgenic animal milk is a cost-effective method for highly complex proteins that cannot be efficiently produced using conventional systems such as microorganisms or animal cells.

To further assess the role of ERs, we also explored the effects of the pure ER antagonist, ICI182780 (ICI), on estrous behavior induced by P and GnRH. Ovariectomized, estrogen-primed rats (5 μg estradiol benzoate 40 hr earlier) were injected intraventricularly with the above-mentioned compounds, or they received VCS. All compounds and VCS effectively facilitated estrous behavior when tested at 60, 120 or 240 min after infusion or application of VCS. Intraventricular infusion of tamoxifen (5 μg), 30 min prior, significantly attenuated estrous behaviors induced in estradiol-primed rats by P, most of its 5α- and 5β-reduced metabolites, GnRH, and PGE2, but not by VCS. Although there was a trend for reduction, tamoxifen did not significantly decrease lordosis in females treated with 5β-pregnan-3,20-dione.

Twenty-milliliter portions of red blood cells (RBCs) were added and processed under various conditions, including clinically relevant first filling and intermittent emptying. RBC recovery and availability and plasma elimination were calculated from the Hct, free hemoglobin, and total protein.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nThe main impediment to recovery and availability was the first filling. There, RBC recovery was significantly reduced, while it subsequently varied between 93 and 98%. To produce the first 30 mL of RBCs, ELECTA required 42 mL and C.A.T.S and OrthoPAT 62 mL owing to the dead space of the separation chamber or reservoir, respectively. RBC availability was much higher in subsequent processes, with only minimal differences between the three devices. They all consistently provided high plasma elimination rates.\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\nThe continuous system showed no advantage over a small Latham bowl.

For each woman who used tamoxifen, the starting and stopping dates were abstracted and the duration of tamoxifen use was calculated. Three hundred and thirty-one women had used tamoxifen (22 %); of these 84 (25 %) had completed four or more years of tamoxifen, the remainder stopped prematurely or were current users. For women with up to 1 year of tamoxifen use, the odds ratio for contralateral breast cancer was 0.37 (95 % CI 0.20-0.69; p = 0.001) compared to women with no tamoxifen use. Among women with 1-4 years of tamoxifen use the odds ratio was 0.53 (95 % CI 0.32-0.87; p = 0.01). Among women with four or more years of tamoxifen use the odds ratio was 0.83 (95 % CI 0.44-1.55; p = 0.55). Short-term use of tamoxifen for chemoprevention in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers may be as effective as a conventional 5-year course of treatment.','2014','Jun','21','2014-06-24 20:18:48',NULL,1,1),(192,3,'blindmurray@gmail.com','24951164','1879-0852','European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)','Increased cardio and cerebrovascular mortality in breast cancer patients treated with postmastectomy radiotherapy - 25 year follow-up of a randomised trial from the South Sweden Breast Cancer Group.','Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Pre-menopausal women were allocated to radiotherapy (RT), RT+oral cyclophosphamide (RT+C) or cyclophosphamide only (C). Post-menopausal women were allocated to RT, RT+Tamoxifen for one year (RT+Tam) or tamoxifen only (Tam). Information on admission to hospital, mortality and causes of death was obtained from national registers.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nAfter 25years, adding RT to cyclophosphamide in pre-menopausal women raised the mortality from heart disease from zero to 0.8% (p=0.04).

These studies have raised significant safety concerns regarding the use of anesthetics in the pediatric population and highlight the need for a better model to study anesthetic-induced neurotoxicity in humans. Human embryonic stem cells are capable of differentiating into any cell type and represent a promising model to study mechanisms governing anesthetic-induced neurotoxicity.\r\nMETHODS::\r\nCell death in human embryonic stem cell-derived neurons was assessed using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate in situ nick end labeling staining, and microRNA expression was assessed using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. miR-21 was overexpressed and knocked down using an miR-21 mimic and antagomir, respectively. Sprouty 2 was knocked down using a small interfering RNA, and the expression of the miR-21 targets of interest was assessed by Western blot.\r\nRESULTS::\r\nPropofol dose and exposure time dependently induced significant cell death (n = 3) in the neurons and down-regulated several microRNAs, including miR-21. Overexpression of miR-21 and knockdown of Sprouty 2 attenuated the increase in terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate in situ nick end labeling-positive cells following propofol exposure. In addition, miR-21 knockdown increased the number of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate in situ nick end labeling-positive cells by 30% (n = 5). Finally, activated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 and protein kinase B (Akt) were down-regulated, and Sprouty 2 was up-regulated following propofol exposure (n = 3).\r\nCONCLUSIONS::\r\nThese data suggest that (1) human embryonic stem cell-derived neurons represent a promising in vitro human model for studying anesthetic-induced neurotoxicity, (2) propofol induces cell death in human embryonic stem cell-derived neurons, and (3) the propofol-induced cell death may occur via a signal transducer and activator of transcription 3/miR-21/Sprouty 2-dependent mechanism.','2014','Jun','19','2014-06-24 20:18:48',NULL,1,1),(195,3,'blindmurray@gmail.com','24949934','1878-5867','Steroids','The evolution of nonsteroidal antiestrogens to become selective estrogen receptor modulators.','Copyright © 2014.

Therefore, the diagnosis can be missed until complications such as perforation or hemorrhage occur. Few reports have investigated the procedures and outcomes of children who have undergone operations for perforated duodenal ulcers. We report our experience with the modified Graham technique for perforated duodenal ulcers in nine children and review the literature. Methods : The records of patients operated on for a perforated duodenal ulcer in the last 8 years in two pediatric surgery centers were evaluated retrospectively. Patient demographics, symptoms, time to admission to hospital, operative findings, and postoperative clinical course were evaluated. Results : Nine children (mean age 13.2 years, range 6-170 years) were included. All patients were admitted in the first six hours after their abdominal pain started. In three patients, there was free air on plain x-rays, while the x-rays were normal in six. All perforations were located on the anterior surface of the first part of the duodenum and repaired with primary suturing and Graham patch omentoplasty. The recovery was uneventful in all patients. In five patients, urea breath tests were performed postoperatively for Helicobacter Pylori, and the results were positive. All patients underwent triple therapy with lansoprazole, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin. The mean follow-up time was 58 (range 3-94) months. Conclusions : Peptic ulcer perforation should be suspected in children who have acute abdominal pain and peritoneal signs, especially when their suffering is intense. The simple patch repair and postoperative triple therapy for Helicobacter Pylori are safe and satisfactory for treating peptic ulcer perforation in children.','2014','May','','2014-06-24 20:18:48',NULL,1,1),(198,3,'blindmurray@gmail.com','24947930','1078-0432','Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research','Acquired resistance to endocrine treatments is associated to tumor-specific molecular changes in patient-derived luminal breast cancer xenografts.','Copyright © 2014, American Association for Cancer Research.','Purpose: patients with luminal breast cancer (LBC) often become endocrine-resistant over time. We investigated the molecular changes associated with acquired hormono-resistances in patient-derived xenografts of LBC. Experimental design: Two LBC xenografts (HBCx22 and HBCx34) were treated with different endocrine therapies (ET) to obtain xenografts with acquired resistances to tamoxifen (TamR) and ovariectomy (OvaR). PI3K pathway activation was analyzed by western blot and immunohistochemistry and responses to ET combined to everolimus were investigated in vivo. Gene expression analyses were performed by RT-PCR and Affymetrix arrays. Results: HBCx22 TamR xenograft was cross-resistant to several hormono-therapies, while HBCx22 OvaR and HBCx34 TamR exhibited a treatment specific resistance profile. PI3K pathway was similarly activated in parental and resistant xenografts but the addition of everolimus didn\'t restore the response to tamoxifen in TamR xenografts. By contrast, the combination of fulvestrant and everolimus induced tumor regression in vivo in HBCx34 TamR, where we found a cross-talk between ER and PI3K pathways. Expression of several ER-controlled genes and ER co-regulators was significantly changed in both TamR and OvaR tumors, indicating impaired ER transcriptional activity. Expression changes associated with hormono-resistance were both tumor and treatment specific and were enriched for genes involved in cell growth, cell death and cell survival. Conclusions: PDX models of LBC with acquired resistance to endocrine therapies show a great diversity of resistance phenotype, associated to specific deregulations of ER-mediated gene transcription. These models offer a tool for developing anticancer therapies and to investigate the dynamics of resistance emerging during pharmacological interventions.','2014','Jun','19','2014-06-24 20:18:48',NULL,1,1),(199,3,'blindmurray@gmail.com','24947863','1439-0531','Reproduction in domestic animals = Zuchthygiene','Causes, diagnosis and therapy of common diseases in neonatal puppies in the first days of life: cornerstones of practical approach.','© 2014 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.','Neonatal diseases and losses are a common and often unavoidable problem within breeding kennels. Altogether, morbidity and mortality ranges, according to the literature, from 5 to 35%. Among non-infectious causes besides hypoxia during birth, hypothermia, hypoglycaemia and dehydration are mostly responsible for puppy diseases and losses. Approximately 90% of all deaths in hypoxaemic pups occur during the first 2 days. Of 183 pups with hypoxia, 63 died, 92.7% of them within 48 h after birth. Among infectious causes, bacterial infection is the most common cause of neonatal mortality. Escherichia coli, streptococci, staphylococci, Pseudomonas sp., Klebsiella sp., Enterobacter sp. and some other micro-organisms are regularly involved in neonatal infections. Post-mortem findings especially document E. coli, Staphylococcus sp. and Streptococcus sp. as responsible bacteria. The dam and the environment are suspected as sources of neonatal infections as it was shown by genetic relatedness of responsible bacterial strains isolated in both puppies and their dams. From a total of 517 puppies with bacterial infections, the treatment results documented that parenteral administration of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid in 308 neonates showed the best result. Diagnosis of diseases is often made difficult by the absence of variability in clinical signs contrary to adult dogs. Findings during a physical examination in pups differ from those in adults.

The pathophysiology remains unclear, although evidence exists that surgical trauma and the use of cardiopulmonary bypass provoke an immune response leading to PPS. We hypothesized that an intraoperative dose of dexamethasone decreases the risk of PPS, by reducing this inflammatory response.\r\nMETHODS:\r\nWe performed a subanalysis of the DECS study, which is a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial of 4,494 patients undergoing cardiac surgery with use of cardiopulmonary bypass. The aim of the DECS study was to investigate whether a single intraoperative dose of 1 mg/kg dexamethasone reduced the incidence of a composite of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, renal failure, or respiratory failure, within 30 days of randomization. In this substudy, we retrospectively analyzed the occurrence of PPS in 822 patients who were included in the DECS trial and underwent valvular surgery. Postpericardiotomy syndrome was diagnosed if 2 of 5 listed symptoms were present: unexplained fever, pleuritic chest pain, pericardial or pleural rub, new or worsening pericardial or pleural effusion. All medical charts, x-rays, and echocardiograms were reviewed. Secondary end point was the occurrence of complicated PPS, defined as PPS with need for evacuation of pleural effusion, pericardiocentesis, and tamponade requiring intervention or hospital readmission for PPS.

Fibulin-6, an ECM protein is expressed in cell junctions particularly in tissues subjected to significant mechanical stress. Fibulin-6 deficiency results in defective cell migration in nematodes and early embryonic lethality in mice. The role of fibulin-6 in healthy and failing myocardium has not been described. We have examined the expression and distribution pattern of fibulin-6 during myocardial remodeling (MR) and detailed its effect on the migratory function of cardiac fibroblasts (CF) in response to TGF-β1.\r\nMETHODS AND RESULTS:\r\nIn healthy murine myocardium fibulin-6 expression is largely confined to larger coronary arteries. It is induced during the early and the late phase of remodeling after infarction in murine hearts predominantly in the scar-muscle junction. Similar results are obtained in human ischemic cardiomyopathy. Fibulin-6 is mostly expressed in close vicinity to vimentin positive cells and is also abundantly expressed in vitro in cultured neonatal CF. TGF-β1 does not induce smooth muscle actin in fibroblasts deficient of fibulin-6, which also compromised their migration. Cells that had migrated expressed more fibulin-6 compared to stationary cells. Plated on fibulin-6 depleted matrix, stress fiber induction in fibroblast in response to TGF-β1 was impaired. In ex vivo explant cultures from postinfarct myocardium, the number of emigrating fibroblasts was also significantly reduced by fibulin-6 siRNA knock down (KD).\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\nFibulin-6, a fibroblast released ECM protein may play an important role during myocardial remodeling by imparting an effect on cardiac fibroblast migration in close and complementary interplay with TGF-β1 signalling.','2014','Jun','20','2014-06-24 20:21:33',NULL,1,1),(203,1,'nick@masomurray.com','24948576','1569-9285','Interactive cardiovascular and thoracic surgery','Computational fluid dynamics of the right ventricular outflow tract and of the pulmonary artery: a bench model of flow dynamics.','© The Author 2014.

The reoperation rate at 5 years can be as high as 25% and depends on age, type of conduit, conduit diameter and principal heart malformation. The aim of this study is to provide a bench model with computer fluid dynamics to analyse the haemodynamics of the RVOT, pulmonary artery, its bifurcation, and left and right pulmonary arteries that in the future may serve as a tool for analysis and prediction of outcome following RVOT reconstruction.\r\nMETHODS:\r\nPressure, flow and diameter at the RVOT, pulmonary artery, bifurcation of the pulmonary artery, and left and right pulmonary arteries were measured in five normal pigs with a mean weight of 24.6 ± 0.89 kg. Data obtained were used for a 3D computer fluid-dynamics simulation of flow conditions, focusing on the pressure, flow and shear stress profile of the pulmonary trunk to the level of the left and right pulmonary arteries.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nThree inlet steady flow profiles were obtained at 0.2, 0.29 and 0.36 m/s that correspond to the flow rates of 1.5, 2.0 and 2.5 l/min flow at the RVOT. The flow velocity profile was constant at the RVOT down to the bifurcation and decreased at the left and right pulmonary arteries. In all three inlet velocity profiles, low sheer stress and low-velocity areas were detected along the left wall of the pulmonary artery, at the pulmonary artery bifurcation and at the ostia of both pulmonary arteries.\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\nThis computed fluid real-time model provides us with a realistic picture of fluid dynamics in the pulmonary tract area. Deep shear stress areas correspond to a turbulent flow profile that is a predictive factor for the development of vessel wall arteriosclerosis.

The type of procedure, perioperative antiplatelet therapy, and other patient-related factors influence the risk of postoperative haemorrhage. Our objective was to analyze the postoperative risk factors for hemorrhagic complications and to determine the impact of antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy strategies on postoperative bleeding risk in patients with coronary stents undergoing non-cardiac surgery.\r\nPATIENTS AND METHODS:\r\nProspective, multicentre observational cohort study of 1134 consecutive patients with coronary stents undergoing non-cardiac surgery between April 2007 and April 2009. The primary outcome measure was the occurrence of an hemorrhagic complication during the first 30days following the surgery or intervention.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nAmong the 1134 patients evaluated, 108 (9.5%) experienced a postoperative hemorrhagic complication (with a median time to occurrence of 5.3days).

Significant systemic arterial hypotension occurred in 14 individuals (26%) and oxygen desaturation in 9 (17%) patients. Administration of an intravenous (IV) vasopressor agent during induction significantly decreased the incidence of hypotension. The type of IV induction agent did not influence hemodynamic alterations, though patients who received propofol experienced a trend towards increased hypotension (83% of pts) when a vasopressor was not used. Inhalational induction, regardless of vasopressor use, was more likely to result in hypotension (60% of pts). The 30-day mortality was 3.8% (two pts). Both patients had minor elective procedures with monitored anesthesia care (MAC).\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\nHypotension is more common in patients with Eisenmenger syndrome and similar physiology when a vasopressor is not used during the peri-induction period, regardless of induction agent. Etomidate tended to have better hemodynamic stability than other induction agents. The use of a vasopressor is recommended. We present general recommendations for anesthesiologists and strongly recommend use of a vasopressor before or during induction to reduce hypotension along with complete avoidance of inhalational induction. Further, MAC anesthesia has been associated with perioperative and 30-day mortality.','2014','Jun','4','2014-06-24 20:21:33',NULL,1,1),(209,1,'nick@masomurray.com','24906370','2047-9980','Journal of the American Heart Association','Assessment of a university of california, los angeles 4-variable risk score for advanced heart failure.','© 2014 The Authors.

The outcome was survival free from urgent transplantation or LVAD. The model-predicted survival was compared to Kaplan-Meier\'s estimated survival at 1, 2, and 3 years. Model discrimination and calibration were assessed. During a mean follow-up of 2.1 years, 37 (21%) events occurred. One-, 2- and 3-year observed event-free survival was 88%, 81%, and 75%, and the observed/predicted ratio was 0.97, 0.96, and 0.97, respectively. Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curve analyses demonstrated good discrimination overall (1-year area under curve, 0.801; 2-year, 0.774; 3-year, 0.837), but discrimination between the 2 highest risk groups was poor. The difference between observed and predicted survival ranged from -14 to +17 percentage points, suggesting poor model calibration. Fairly similar results were found when the analyses were repeated in 715 patients after multivariate imputation of missing data.\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\nThe UCLA 4-variable risk model calibration was inconsistent and high-risk discrimination was poor in an external validation cohort.

While donor identity of DNA extracted directly from blood collected in standard tubes containing anticoagulants can be easily verified by generating STR profiles, RNA from blood collected in PAXgene Blood RNA tubes (PAXgene RNA tubes) is depleted of DNA and is not amenable to STR fingerprinting for donor identity verification.

Use of these catheters as a continuous monitor, however, is fraught with complexities and limitations.\r\nMETHODS:\r\nExamples of the limitations and optimal use of conductance catheters as a continuous, real-time monitor of cardiovascular function are demonstrated during inotropic drug infusion in anesthetised rats.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nInotropic drug infusion may alter ventricular dimensions causing relative movement of a well-positioned catheter, generating artifacts, including an abrupt pressure rise at end-systole that leads to over estimation of indices of contractility (max dP/dt) and loss of stroke volume signal. Simple rotation of the catheter, echocardiography-guided placement to the centre of the ventricle, or ventricular expansion through crystalloid infusion may correct for these artifacts. Fluid administration, however, alters left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and volume and therefore stroke volume, thereby obscuring continuous real-time haemodynamic measurements.\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\nPressure-volume artifacts during inotropic infusion are caused by physical contact of the catheter with endocardium. Repeated correction of catheter position may be required to use pressure volume catheters as a continuous real-time monitor during manipulations that alter ventricular dimensions, such as inotropic therapy.','2014','May','22','2014-06-24 20:21:39',NULL,1,1),(231,2,'nickm@masomurray.com','24954500','1755-5949','CNS neuroscience ','Anticoagulation Therapy is Harmful to Large-Sized Cerebellar Infarction.','© 2014 John Wiley ','\r\nAIM:\r\nAnticoagulants are commonly used to treat ischemic stroke.

The effect of antithrombotic drugs have been examined in experimental and clinical studies but results are still inconclusive. Thrombotic-related vascular disease such as myocardial infarction, stroke and venous thrombosis may complicate the clinical course of pneumonia and worsen its prognosis.

All rights reserved.','\r\nAIM OF THE STUDY:\r\nMast cell (MC) degranulation contributes to the protection mediated by ischemic preconditioning (IPC); however, the precise mechanisms underlying this protection remain largely unknown. Mast cell carboxypeptidase A (MC-CPA) is released solely from MCs and plays a critical role in degrading toxins and endothelin 1 (ET-1). The present study sought to explore whether MC-CPA is involved in the process of IPC in a rodent model of small intestinal ischemia reperfusion (IIR) injury.\r\nMATERIALS AND METHODS:\r\nIIR injuries were induced in Sprague-Dawley rats by clamping the superior mesenteric artery for 60 min followed by reperfusion for 2 h. One cycle of 10 min intestinal ischemia and 10 min of reperfusion was used in the IPC group, and the MC stabilizer cromolyn sodium and MC potato carboxypeptidase inhibitor were administered before the start of IPC. At the end of experiment, intestine tissue was obtained for assays of the MC-CPA3, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, and ET-1 contents and myeloperoxidase activities. Intestinal histologic injury scores and MC degranulation were assessed. Apoptosis indices and cleaved caspase- 3 protein expressions were quantified.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nIIR resulted in severe injury, as evidenced by significant increases in injury scores and MC-CPA3, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, and ET-1 contents that were accompanied with concomitant elevations in cleaved caspase 3 expression, apoptosis indices, and myeloperoxidase activities. IPC induced a significant increase in MC-CPA3, induced MC degranulation, and attenuated IIR injury by downregulating IIR-induced biochemical changes, whereas cromolyn sodium and potato carboxypeptidase inhibitor abolished the IPC-mediated changes.\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\nThese data suggest that IPC protected against IIR injury via the MC degranulation-mediated release of MC-CPA.','2014','May','23','2014-06-24 20:21:39',NULL,1,1),(240,2,'nickm@masomurray.com','24953890','1523-6838','American journal of kidney diseases : the official journal of the National Kidney Foundation','Serum Bicarbonate Concentrations and Kidney Disease Progression in Community-Living Elders: The Health, Aging, and Body Composition (Health ABC) Study.','Published by Elsevier Inc.','\r\nBACKGROUND:\r\nIn populations with prevalent chronic kidney disease (CKD), lower serum bicarbonate levels are associated with more rapid CKD progression, but whether lower bicarbonate levels also are associated with risk of incident estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)\r\nSTUDY DESIGN:\r\nLongitudinal observational cohort study.\r\nSETTING & PARTICIPANTS:\r\nWell-functioning community-living elders aged 70-79 years at inception.\r\nPREDICTOR:\r\nSerum bicarbonate level measured at the time of collection by arterialized venous blood sample using an arterial blood gas analyzer.\r\nOUTCOMES:\r\nChange in eGFR over 7 years, and new eGFR\r\nMEASUREMENTS:\r\nLinear and logistic regressions were used to evaluate associations of baseline serum bicarbonate level with change in eGFR and incident eGFR\r\nRESULTS:\r\nAt baseline, mean eGFR was 84±16 (SD)mL/min/1.73m(2), and serum bicarbonate level was 25.2±1.9mmol/L.

The in vivo role of FoxO1 in the regulation of cardiac NaV1.5 expression remains unknown. The present study aimed to define the role of FoxO1 in the regulation of NaV1.5 expression and cardiac Na(+) channel activity in mouse ventricular cardiomyocytes and assess the cardiac electrophysiological phenotype of mice with cardiac FoxO1 deletion. Tamoxifen-induced and cardiac-specific FoxO1 deletion was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Cardiac FoxO1 deletion failed to result in either cardiac functional changes or hypertrophy as assessed by echocardiography and individual ventricular cell capacitances, respectively. Western blotting showed that FoxO1 was significantly decreased while NaV1.5 protein level was significantly increased in mouse hearts with FoxO1 deletion. Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) revealed that FoxO1 deletion led to an increase in NaV1.5 and Na(+) channel subunit β3 mRNA, but not β1, 2, 4, or connexin 43. Whole patch-clamp recordings demonstrated that cardiac Na(+) currents were significantly augmented by FoxO1 deletion without affecting the steady-state activation and inactivation, leading to accelerated depolarization of action potentials in mouse ventricular cardiomyocytes. Electrocardiogram recordings showed that the QRS complex was significantly shortened and P wave amplitude was significantly increased in conscious and unrestrained mice with cardiac FoxO1 deletion. NaV1.5 expression was decreased in the peri-infarct (border-zone) of mice with myocardial infarction and FoxO1 accumulated in the cardiomyocyte nuclei of chronic ischemic human hearts. Our findings indicate that FoxO1 plays an important role in the regulation of NaV1.5 and β3 subunit expression as well as Na(+) channel activity in the heart and that FoxO1 is involved in the modulation of NaV1.5 expression in ischemic heart disease.','2014','Jun','20','2014-06-24 20:21:43',NULL,1,1),(242,3,'blindmurray@gmail.com','24955355','2314-6141','BioMed research international','Recombinant Human Factor IX Produced from Transgenic Porcine Milk.','','Production of biopharmaceuticals from transgenic animal milk is a cost-effective method for highly complex proteins that cannot be efficiently produced using conventional systems such as microorganisms or animal cells.

Ovariectomized, estrogen-primed rats (5 μg estradiol benzoate 40 hr earlier) were injected intraventricularly with the above-mentioned compounds, or they received VCS.

Thirty-three experts from 16 countries were involved. A systematic multiple-database, double-track literature search (January 1980 to September 2013) was performed. The Grading of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation method was used to determine the quality of available evidence and subsequent development of the recommendations. Evidence-based panel judgment and consensus was collected and analyzed by means of the RAND appropriateness method.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nDuring four conferences (in New Delhi, Milan, Boston, and Barcelona), 108 statements were elaborated and discussed. Face-to-face debates were held in two rounds using the modified Delphi technique. Disagreement occurred for 10 statements. Weak or conditional recommendations were made for two statements and strong or very strong recommendations for 96. These recommendations delineate the nature, applications, technique, potential benefits, clinical integration, education, and certification principles for FoCUS, both for adults and pediatric patients.\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\nThis document presents the results of the first International Conference on FoCUS. For the first time, evidence-based clinical recommendations comprehensively address this branch of point-of-care ultrasound, providing a framework for FoCUS to standardize its application in different clinical settings around the world.','2014','Jul','','2014-06-24 20:21:43',NULL,1,1),(251,3,'blindmurray@gmail.com','24951267','1573-7217','Breast cancer research and treatment','Duration of tamoxifen use and the risk of contralateral breast cancer in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers.','','Women with a mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2 face a lifetime risk of breast cancer of approximately 80 %.

These studies have raised significant safety concerns regarding the use of anesthetics in the pediatric population and highlight the need for a better model to study anesthetic-induced neurotoxicity in humans. Human embryonic stem cells are capable of differentiating into any cell type and represent a promising model to study mechanisms governing anesthetic-induced neurotoxicity.\r\nMETHODS::\r\nCell death in human embryonic stem cell-derived neurons was assessed using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate in situ nick end labeling staining, and microRNA expression was assessed using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. miR-21 was overexpressed and knocked down using an miR-21 mimic and antagomir, respectively. Sprouty 2 was knocked down using a small interfering RNA, and the expression of the miR-21 targets of interest was assessed by Western blot.\r\nRESULTS::\r\nPropofol dose and exposure time dependently induced significant cell death (n = 3) in the neurons and down-regulated several microRNAs, including miR-21. Overexpression of miR-21 and knockdown of Sprouty 2 attenuated the increase in terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate in situ nick end labeling-positive cells following propofol exposure. In addition, miR-21 knockdown increased the number of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate in situ nick end labeling-positive cells by 30% (n = 5).

Therefore, the diagnosis can be missed until complications such as perforation or hemorrhage occur. Few reports have investigated the procedures and outcomes of children who have undergone operations for perforated duodenal ulcers. We report our experience with the modified Graham technique for perforated duodenal ulcers in nine children and review the literature. Methods : The records of patients operated on for a perforated duodenal ulcer in the last 8 years in two pediatric surgery centers were evaluated retrospectively. Patient demographics, symptoms, time to admission to hospital, operative findings, and postoperative clinical course were evaluated. Results : Nine children (mean age 13.2 years, range 6-170 years) were included. All patients were admitted in the first six hours after their abdominal pain started. In three patients, there was free air on plain x-rays, while the x-rays were normal in six. All perforations were located on the anterior surface of the first part of the duodenum and repaired with primary suturing and Graham patch omentoplasty. The recovery was uneventful in all patients. In five patients, urea breath tests were performed postoperatively for Helicobacter Pylori, and the results were positive. All patients underwent triple therapy with lansoprazole, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin. The mean follow-up time was 58 (range 3-94) months. Conclusions : Peptic ulcer perforation should be suspected in children who have acute abdominal pain and peritoneal signs, especially when their suffering is intense.

We investigated the molecular changes associated with acquired hormono-resistances in patient-derived xenografts of LBC. Experimental design: Two LBC xenografts (HBCx22 and HBCx34) were treated with different endocrine therapies (ET) to obtain xenografts with acquired resistances to tamoxifen (TamR) and ovariectomy (OvaR). PI3K pathway activation was analyzed by western blot and immunohistochemistry and responses to ET combined to everolimus were investigated in vivo. Gene expression analyses were performed by RT-PCR and Affymetrix arrays. Results: HBCx22 TamR xenograft was cross-resistant to several hormono-therapies, while HBCx22 OvaR and HBCx34 TamR exhibited a treatment specific resistance profile. PI3K pathway was similarly activated in parental and resistant xenografts but the addition of everolimus didn\'t restore the response to tamoxifen in TamR xenografts. By contrast, the combination of fulvestrant and everolimus induced tumor regression in vivo in HBCx34 TamR, where we found a cross-talk between ER and PI3K pathways. Expression of several ER-controlled genes and ER co-regulators was significantly changed in both TamR and OvaR tumors, indicating impaired ER transcriptional activity. Expression changes associated with hormono-resistance were both tumor and treatment specific and were enriched for genes involved in cell growth, cell death and cell survival. Conclusions: PDX models of LBC with acquired resistance to endocrine therapies show a great diversity of resistance phenotype, associated to specific deregulations of ER-mediated gene transcription. These models offer a tool for developing anticancer therapies and to investigate the dynamics of resistance emerging during pharmacological interventions.','2014','Jun','19','2014-06-24 20:21:43',NULL,1,1),(259,3,'blindmurray@gmail.com','24947863','1439-0531','Reproduction in domestic animals = Zuchthygiene','Causes, diagnosis and therapy of common diseases in neonatal puppies in the first days of life: cornerstones of practical approach.','© 2014 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.','Neonatal diseases and losses are a common and often unavoidable problem within breeding kennels. Altogether, morbidity and mortality ranges, according to the literature, from 5 to 35%. Among non-infectious causes besides hypoxia during birth, hypothermia, hypoglycaemia and dehydration are mostly responsible for puppy diseases and losses. Approximately 90% of all deaths in hypoxaemic pups occur during the first 2 days. Of 183 pups with hypoxia, 63 died, 92.7% of them within 48 h after birth. Among infectious causes, bacterial infection is the most common cause of neonatal mortality. Escherichia coli, streptococci, staphylococci, Pseudomonas sp., Klebsiella sp., Enterobacter sp. and some other micro-organisms are regularly involved in neonatal infections. Post-mortem findings especially document E. coli, Staphylococcus sp. and Streptococcus sp. as responsible bacteria. The dam and the environment are suspected as sources of neonatal infections as it was shown by genetic relatedness of responsible bacterial strains isolated in both puppies and their dams. From a total of 517 puppies with bacterial infections, the treatment results documented that parenteral administration of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid in 308 neonates showed the best result. Diagnosis of diseases is often made difficult by the absence of variability in clinical signs contrary to adult dogs. Findings during a physical examination in pups differ from those in adults.

The pathophysiology remains unclear, although evidence exists that surgical trauma and the use of cardiopulmonary bypass provoke an immune response leading to PPS. We hypothesized that an intraoperative dose of dexamethasone decreases the risk of PPS, by reducing this inflammatory response.\r\nMETHODS:\r\nWe performed a subanalysis of the DECS study, which is a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial of 4,494 patients undergoing cardiac surgery with use of cardiopulmonary bypass. The aim of the DECS study was to investigate whether a single intraoperative dose of 1 mg/kg dexamethasone reduced the incidence of a composite of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, renal failure, or respiratory failure, within 30 days of randomization. In this substudy, we retrospectively analyzed the occurrence of PPS in 822 patients who were included in the DECS trial and underwent valvular surgery. Postpericardiotomy syndrome was diagnosed if 2 of 5 listed symptoms were present: unexplained fever, pleuritic chest pain, pericardial or pleural rub, new or worsening pericardial or pleural effusion. All medical charts, x-rays, and echocardiograms were reviewed.

Fibulin-6, an ECM protein is expressed in cell junctions particularly in tissues subjected to significant mechanical stress. Fibulin-6 deficiency results in defective cell migration in nematodes and early embryonic lethality in mice. The role of fibulin-6 in healthy and failing myocardium has not been described. We have examined the expression and distribution pattern of fibulin-6 during myocardial remodeling (MR) and detailed its effect on the migratory function of cardiac fibroblasts (CF) in response to TGF-β1.\r\nMETHODS AND RESULTS:\r\nIn healthy murine myocardium fibulin-6 expression is largely confined to larger coronary arteries. It is induced during the early and the late phase of remodeling after infarction in murine hearts predominantly in the scar-muscle junction. Similar results are obtained in human ischemic cardiomyopathy. Fibulin-6 is mostly expressed in close vicinity to vimentin positive cells and is also abundantly expressed in vitro in cultured neonatal CF. TGF-β1 does not induce smooth muscle actin in fibroblasts deficient of fibulin-6, which also compromised their migration. Cells that had migrated expressed more fibulin-6 compared to stationary cells. Plated on fibulin-6 depleted matrix, stress fiber induction in fibroblast in response to TGF-β1 was impaired. In ex vivo explant cultures from postinfarct myocardium, the number of emigrating fibroblasts was also significantly reduced by fibulin-6 siRNA knock down (KD).\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\nFibulin-6, a fibroblast released ECM protein may play an important role during myocardial remodeling by imparting an effect on cardiac fibroblast migration in close and complementary interplay with TGF-β1 signalling.','2014','Jun','20','2014-06-24 20:24:53',NULL,1,1),(263,1,'nick@masomurray.com','24948576','1569-9285','Interactive cardiovascular and thoracic surgery','Computational fluid dynamics of the right ventricular outflow tract and of the pulmonary artery: a bench model of flow dynamics.','© The Author 2014.

The reoperation rate at 5 years can be as high as 25% and depends on age, type of conduit, conduit diameter and principal heart malformation. The aim of this study is to provide a bench model with computer fluid dynamics to analyse the haemodynamics of the RVOT, pulmonary artery, its bifurcation, and left and right pulmonary arteries that in the future may serve as a tool for analysis and prediction of outcome following RVOT reconstruction.\r\nMETHODS:\r\nPressure, flow and diameter at the RVOT, pulmonary artery, bifurcation of the pulmonary artery, and left and right pulmonary arteries were measured in five normal pigs with a mean weight of 24.6 ± 0.89 kg. Data obtained were used for a 3D computer fluid-dynamics simulation of flow conditions, focusing on the pressure, flow and shear stress profile of the pulmonary trunk to the level of the left and right pulmonary arteries.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nThree inlet steady flow profiles were obtained at 0.2, 0.29 and 0.36 m/s that correspond to the flow rates of 1.5, 2.0 and 2.5 l/min flow at the RVOT. The flow velocity profile was constant at the RVOT down to the bifurcation and decreased at the left and right pulmonary arteries. In all three inlet velocity profiles, low sheer stress and low-velocity areas were detected along the left wall of the pulmonary artery, at the pulmonary artery bifurcation and at the ostia of both pulmonary arteries.\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\nThis computed fluid real-time model provides us with a realistic picture of fluid dynamics in the pulmonary tract area. Deep shear stress areas correspond to a turbulent flow profile that is a predictive factor for the development of vessel wall arteriosclerosis.

The type of procedure, perioperative antiplatelet therapy, and other patient-related factors influence the risk of postoperative haemorrhage. Our objective was to analyze the postoperative risk factors for hemorrhagic complications and to determine the impact of antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy strategies on postoperative bleeding risk in patients with coronary stents undergoing non-cardiac surgery.\r\nPATIENTS AND METHODS:\r\nProspective, multicentre observational cohort study of 1134 consecutive patients with coronary stents undergoing non-cardiac surgery between April 2007 and April 2009. The primary outcome measure was the occurrence of an hemorrhagic complication during the first 30days following the surgery or intervention.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nAmong the 1134 patients evaluated, 108 (9.5%) experienced a postoperative hemorrhagic complication (with a median time to occurrence of 5.3days). These complications were considered major, involved the operative site, and required reoperation in 92 (85.2%), 92 (85.2%), and 20 (18.5%) of patients, respectively. Mortality in patients with a haemorrhagic complication was 12% (n=13). Independent postoperative factors associated with haemorrhagic complications were identified as a high and intermediate bleeding risk procedure and the use and dose of anticoagulants. When interrupted before the procedure, resumption of antiplatelet treatment was delayed in patients developing early postoperative hemorrhagic complications.\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\nPatients with coronary stents who undergo surgery are at high risk for hemorrhagic complications.','2014','May','15','2014-06-24 20:24:53',NULL,1,1),(268,1,'nick@masomurray.com','24908593','1873-4529','Journal of clinical anesthesia','Anesthetic management and outcomes for patients with pulmonary hypertension and intracardiac shunts and Eisenmenger syndrome: a review of institutional experience.','Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Significant systemic arterial hypotension occurred in 14 individuals (26%) and oxygen desaturation in 9 (17%) patients. Administration of an intravenous (IV) vasopressor agent during induction significantly decreased the incidence of hypotension. The type of IV induction agent did not influence hemodynamic alterations, though patients who received propofol experienced a trend towards increased hypotension (83% of pts) when a vasopressor was not used. Inhalational induction, regardless of vasopressor use, was more likely to result in hypotension (60% of pts). The 30-day mortality was 3.8% (two pts). Both patients had minor elective procedures with monitored anesthesia care (MAC).\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\nHypotension is more common in patients with Eisenmenger syndrome and similar physiology when a vasopressor is not used during the peri-induction period, regardless of induction agent. Etomidate tended to have better hemodynamic stability than other induction agents. The use of a vasopressor is recommended. We present general recommendations for anesthesiologists and strongly recommend use of a vasopressor before or during induction to reduce hypotension along with complete avoidance of inhalational induction. Further, MAC anesthesia has been associated with perioperative and 30-day mortality.','2014','Jun','4','2014-06-24 20:24:53',NULL,1,1),(269,1,'nick@masomurray.com','24906370','2047-9980','Journal of the American Heart Association','Assessment of a university of california, los angeles 4-variable risk score for advanced heart failure.','© 2014 The Authors.

The outcome was survival free from urgent transplantation or LVAD. The model-predicted survival was compared to Kaplan-Meier\'s estimated survival at 1, 2, and 3 years. Model discrimination and calibration were assessed. During a mean follow-up of 2.1 years, 37 (21%) events occurred. One-, 2- and 3-year observed event-free survival was 88%, 81%, and 75%, and the observed/predicted ratio was 0.97, 0.96, and 0.97, respectively. Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curve analyses demonstrated good discrimination overall (1-year area under curve, 0.801; 2-year, 0.774; 3-year, 0.837), but discrimination between the 2 highest risk groups was poor. The difference between observed and predicted survival ranged from -14 to +17 percentage points, suggesting poor model calibration. Fairly similar results were found when the analyses were repeated in 715 patients after multivariate imputation of missing data.\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\nThe UCLA 4-variable risk model calibration was inconsistent and high-risk discrimination was poor in an external validation cohort.

While donor identity of DNA extracted directly from blood collected in standard tubes containing anticoagulants can be easily verified by generating STR profiles, RNA from blood collected in PAXgene Blood RNA tubes (PAXgene RNA tubes) is depleted of DNA and is not amenable to STR fingerprinting for donor identity verification.

Use of these catheters as a continuous monitor, however, is fraught with complexities and limitations.\r\nMETHODS:\r\nExamples of the limitations and optimal use of conductance catheters as a continuous, real-time monitor of cardiovascular function are demonstrated during inotropic drug infusion in anesthetised rats.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nInotropic drug infusion may alter ventricular dimensions causing relative movement of a well-positioned catheter, generating artifacts, including an abrupt pressure rise at end-systole that leads to over estimation of indices of contractility (max dP/dt) and loss of stroke volume signal. Simple rotation of the catheter, echocardiography-guided placement to the centre of the ventricle, or ventricular expansion through crystalloid infusion may correct for these artifacts. Fluid administration, however, alters left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and volume and therefore stroke volume, thereby obscuring continuous real-time haemodynamic measurements.\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\nPressure-volume artifacts during inotropic infusion are caused by physical contact of the catheter with endocardium. Repeated correction of catheter position may be required to use pressure volume catheters as a continuous real-time monitor during manipulations that alter ventricular dimensions, such as inotropic therapy.','2014','May','22','2014-06-24 20:24:58',NULL,1,1),(291,2,'nickm@masomurray.com','24954500','1755-5949','CNS neuroscience ','Anticoagulation Therapy is Harmful to Large-Sized Cerebellar Infarction.','© 2014 John Wiley ','\r\nAIM:\r\nAnticoagulants are commonly used to treat ischemic stroke.

All rights reserved.','\r\nAIM OF THE STUDY:\r\nMast cell (MC) degranulation contributes to the protection mediated by ischemic preconditioning (IPC); however, the precise mechanisms underlying this protection remain largely unknown. Mast cell carboxypeptidase A (MC-CPA) is released solely from MCs and plays a critical role in degrading toxins and endothelin 1 (ET-1). The present study sought to explore whether MC-CPA is involved in the process of IPC in a rodent model of small intestinal ischemia reperfusion (IIR) injury.\r\nMATERIALS AND METHODS:\r\nIIR injuries were induced in Sprague-Dawley rats by clamping the superior mesenteric artery for 60 min followed by reperfusion for 2 h. One cycle of 10 min intestinal ischemia and 10 min of reperfusion was used in the IPC group, and the MC stabilizer cromolyn sodium and MC potato carboxypeptidase inhibitor were administered before the start of IPC. At the end of experiment, intestine tissue was obtained for assays of the MC-CPA3, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, and ET-1 contents and myeloperoxidase activities. Intestinal histologic injury scores and MC degranulation were assessed. Apoptosis indices and cleaved caspase- 3 protein expressions were quantified.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nIIR resulted in severe injury, as evidenced by significant increases in injury scores and MC-CPA3, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, and ET-1 contents that were accompanied with concomitant elevations in cleaved caspase 3 expression, apoptosis indices, and myeloperoxidase activities. IPC induced a significant increase in MC-CPA3, induced MC degranulation, and attenuated IIR injury by downregulating IIR-induced biochemical changes, whereas cromolyn sodium and potato carboxypeptidase inhibitor abolished the IPC-mediated changes.\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\nThese data suggest that IPC protected against IIR injury via the MC degranulation-mediated release of MC-CPA.','2014','May','23','2014-06-24 20:24:58',NULL,1,1),(300,2,'nickm@masomurray.com','24953890','1523-6838','American journal of kidney diseases : the official journal of the National Kidney Foundation','Serum Bicarbonate Concentrations and Kidney Disease Progression in Community-Living Elders: The Health, Aging, and Body Composition (Health ABC) Study.','Published by Elsevier Inc.','\r\nBACKGROUND:\r\nIn populations with prevalent chronic kidney disease (CKD), lower serum bicarbonate levels are associated with more rapid CKD progression, but whether lower bicarbonate levels also are associated with risk of incident estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)\r\nSTUDY DESIGN:\r\nLongitudinal observational cohort study.\r\nSETTING & PARTICIPANTS:\r\nWell-functioning community-living elders aged 70-79 years at inception.\r\nPREDICTOR:\r\nSerum bicarbonate level measured at the time of collection by arterialized venous blood sample using an arterial blood gas analyzer.\r\nOUTCOMES:\r\nChange in eGFR over 7 years, and new eGFR\r\nMEASUREMENTS:\r\nLinear and logistic regressions were used to evaluate associations of baseline serum bicarbonate level with change in eGFR and incident eGFR\r\nRESULTS:\r\nAt baseline, mean eGFR was 84±16 (SD)mL/min/1.73m(2), and serum bicarbonate level was 25.2±1.9mmol/L.

The in vivo role of FoxO1 in the regulation of cardiac NaV1.5 expression remains unknown. The present study aimed to define the role of FoxO1 in the regulation of NaV1.5 expression and cardiac Na(+) channel activity in mouse ventricular cardiomyocytes and assess the cardiac electrophysiological phenotype of mice with cardiac FoxO1 deletion. Tamoxifen-induced and cardiac-specific FoxO1 deletion was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Cardiac FoxO1 deletion failed to result in either cardiac functional changes or hypertrophy as assessed by echocardiography and individual ventricular cell capacitances, respectively. Western blotting showed that FoxO1 was significantly decreased while NaV1.5 protein level was significantly increased in mouse hearts with FoxO1 deletion. Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) revealed that FoxO1 deletion led to an increase in NaV1.5 and Na(+) channel subunit β3 mRNA, but not β1, 2, 4, or connexin 43. Whole patch-clamp recordings demonstrated that cardiac Na(+) currents were significantly augmented by FoxO1 deletion without affecting the steady-state activation and inactivation, leading to accelerated depolarization of action potentials in mouse ventricular cardiomyocytes. Electrocardiogram recordings showed that the QRS complex was significantly shortened and P wave amplitude was significantly increased in conscious and unrestrained mice with cardiac FoxO1 deletion. NaV1.5 expression was decreased in the peri-infarct (border-zone) of mice with myocardial infarction and FoxO1 accumulated in the cardiomyocyte nuclei of chronic ischemic human hearts. Our findings indicate that FoxO1 plays an important role in the regulation of NaV1.5 and β3 subunit expression as well as Na(+) channel activity in the heart and that FoxO1 is involved in the modulation of NaV1.5 expression in ischemic heart disease.','2014','Jun','20','2014-06-24 20:25:05',NULL,1,1),(302,3,'blindmurray@gmail.com','24955355','2314-6141','BioMed research international','Recombinant Human Factor IX Produced from Transgenic Porcine Milk.','','Production of biopharmaceuticals from transgenic animal milk is a cost-effective method for highly complex proteins that cannot be efficiently produced using conventional systems such as microorganisms or animal cells.

To further assess the role of ERs, we also explored the effects of the pure ER antagonist, ICI182780 (ICI), on estrous behavior induced by P and GnRH. Ovariectomized, estrogen-primed rats (5 μg estradiol benzoate 40 hr earlier) were injected intraventricularly with the above-mentioned compounds, or they received VCS. All compounds and VCS effectively facilitated estrous behavior when tested at 60, 120 or 240 min after infusion or application of VCS.

Although there was a trend for reduction, tamoxifen did not significantly decrease lordosis in females treated with 5β-pregnan-3,20-dione.

However, the minimal blood volume for effective processing under clinically relevant conditions has yet to be determined.\r\nSTUDY DESIGN AND METHODS:\r\nFresh blood from volunteer donations adjusted to a hematocrit (Hct) of 10% was used to test ELECTA (Sorin) equipped with a 55-mL bowl, C.A.T.S (Fresenius) in the pediatric program mode, and OrthoPAT (Haemonetics). Twenty-milliliter portions of red blood cells (RBCs) were added and processed under various conditions, including clinically relevant first filling and intermittent emptying. RBC recovery and availability and plasma elimination were calculated from the Hct, free hemoglobin, and total protein.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nThe main impediment to recovery and availability was the first filling. There, RBC recovery was significantly reduced, while it subsequently varied between 93 and 98%. To produce the first 30 mL of RBCs, ELECTA required 42 mL and C.A.T.S and OrthoPAT 62 mL owing to the dead space of the separation chamber or reservoir, respectively. RBC availability was much higher in subsequent processes, with only minimal differences between the three devices. They all consistently provided high plasma elimination rates.\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\nThe continuous system showed no advantage over a small Latham bowl. From the results it can be calculated that the limit for feasible cell salvage at present is an infant of 6 months. All three devices are suitable for the processing of small volumes, but have the scope for further optimization.','2014','Jun','23','2014-06-24 20:25:05',NULL,1,1),(310,3,'blindmurray@gmail.com','24951446','1097-6795','Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography : official publication of the American Society of Echocardiography','International evidence-based recommendations for focused cardiac ultrasound.','Copyright © 2014.

A need exists for quality evidence-based review and clinical recommendations on its use.\r\nMETHODS:\r\nThe World Interactive Network Focused on Critical UltraSound conducted an international, multispecialty, evidence-based, methodologically rigorous consensus process on FoCUS. Thirty-three experts from 16 countries were involved. A systematic multiple-database, double-track literature search (January 1980 to September 2013) was performed. The Grading of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation method was used to determine the quality of available evidence and subsequent development of the recommendations. Evidence-based panel judgment and consensus was collected and analyzed by means of the RAND appropriateness method.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nDuring four conferences (in New Delhi, Milan, Boston, and Barcelona), 108 statements were elaborated and discussed. Face-to-face debates were held in two rounds using the modified Delphi technique. Disagreement occurred for 10 statements.

These studies have raised significant safety concerns regarding the use of anesthetics in the pediatric population and highlight the need for a better model to study anesthetic-induced neurotoxicity in humans. Human embryonic stem cells are capable of differentiating into any cell type and represent a promising model to study mechanisms governing anesthetic-induced neurotoxicity.\r\nMETHODS::\r\nCell death in human embryonic stem cell-derived neurons was assessed using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate in situ nick end labeling staining, and microRNA expression was assessed using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. miR-21 was overexpressed and knocked down using an miR-21 mimic and antagomir, respectively.

Few reports have investigated the procedures and outcomes of children who have undergone operations for perforated duodenal ulcers. We report our experience with the modified Graham technique for perforated duodenal ulcers in nine children and review the literature. Methods : The records of patients operated on for a perforated duodenal ulcer in the last 8 years in two pediatric surgery centers were evaluated retrospectively. Patient demographics, symptoms, time to admission to hospital, operative findings, and postoperative clinical course were evaluated. Results : Nine children (mean age 13.2 years, range 6-170 years) were included. All patients were admitted in the first six hours after their abdominal pain started. In three patients, there was free air on plain x-rays, while the x-rays were normal in six. All perforations were located on the anterior surface of the first part of the duodenum and repaired with primary suturing and Graham patch omentoplasty. The recovery was uneventful in all patients. In five patients, urea breath tests were performed postoperatively for Helicobacter Pylori, and the results were positive. All patients underwent triple therapy with lansoprazole, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin. The mean follow-up time was 58 (range 3-94) months.

We investigated the molecular changes associated with acquired hormono-resistances in patient-derived xenografts of LBC. Experimental design: Two LBC xenografts (HBCx22 and HBCx34) were treated with different endocrine therapies (ET) to obtain xenografts with acquired resistances to tamoxifen (TamR) and ovariectomy (OvaR). PI3K pathway activation was analyzed by western blot and immunohistochemistry and responses to ET combined to everolimus were investigated in vivo. Gene expression analyses were performed by RT-PCR and Affymetrix arrays. Results: HBCx22 TamR xenograft was cross-resistant to several hormono-therapies, while HBCx22 OvaR and HBCx34 TamR exhibited a treatment specific resistance profile. PI3K pathway was similarly activated in parental and resistant xenografts but the addition of everolimus didn\'t restore the response to tamoxifen in TamR xenografts. By contrast, the combination of fulvestrant and everolimus induced tumor regression in vivo in HBCx34 TamR, where we found a cross-talk between ER and PI3K pathways. Expression of several ER-controlled genes and ER co-regulators was significantly changed in both TamR and OvaR tumors, indicating impaired ER transcriptional activity. Expression changes associated with hormono-resistance were both tumor and treatment specific and were enriched for genes involved in cell growth, cell death and cell survival. Conclusions: PDX models of LBC with acquired resistance to endocrine therapies show a great diversity of resistance phenotype, associated to specific deregulations of ER-mediated gene transcription. These models offer a tool for developing anticancer therapies and to investigate the dynamics of resistance emerging during pharmacological interventions.','2014','Jun','19','2014-06-24 20:25:05',NULL,1,1),(319,3,'blindmurray@gmail.com','24947863','1439-0531','Reproduction in domestic animals = Zuchthygiene','Causes, diagnosis and therapy of common diseases in neonatal puppies in the first days of life: cornerstones of practical approach.','© 2014 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.','Neonatal diseases and losses are a common and often unavoidable problem within breeding kennels. Altogether, morbidity and mortality ranges, according to the literature, from 5 to 35%. Among non-infectious causes besides hypoxia during birth, hypothermia, hypoglycaemia and dehydration are mostly responsible for puppy diseases and losses. Approximately 90% of all deaths in hypoxaemic pups occur during the first 2 days. Of 183 pups with hypoxia, 63 died, 92.7% of them within 48 h after birth. Among infectious causes, bacterial infection is the most common cause of neonatal mortality. Escherichia coli, streptococci, staphylococci, Pseudomonas sp., Klebsiella sp., Enterobacter sp. and some other micro-organisms are regularly involved in neonatal infections. Post-mortem findings especially document E. coli, Staphylococcus sp. and Streptococcus sp. as responsible bacteria. The dam and the environment are suspected as sources of neonatal infections as it was shown by genetic relatedness of responsible bacterial strains isolated in both puppies and their dams. From a total of 517 puppies with bacterial infections, the treatment results documented that parenteral administration of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid in 308 neonates showed the best result. Diagnosis of diseases is often made difficult by the absence of variability in clinical signs contrary to adult dogs. Findings during a physical examination in pups differ from those in adults.

The aim of the DECS study was to investigate whether a single intraoperative dose of 1 mg/kg dexamethasone reduced the incidence of a composite of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, renal failure, or respiratory failure, within 30 days of randomization. In this substudy, we retrospectively analyzed the occurrence of PPS in 822 patients who were included in the DECS trial and underwent valvular surgery.

Fibulin-6, an ECM protein is expressed in cell junctions particularly in tissues subjected to significant mechanical stress. Fibulin-6 deficiency results in defective cell migration in nematodes and early embryonic lethality in mice. The role of fibulin-6 in healthy and failing myocardium has not been described. We have examined the expression and distribution pattern of fibulin-6 during myocardial remodeling (MR) and detailed its effect on the migratory function of cardiac fibroblasts (CF) in response to TGF-β1.\r\nMETHODS AND RESULTS:\r\nIn healthy murine myocardium fibulin-6 expression is largely confined to larger coronary arteries. It is induced during the early and the late phase of remodeling after infarction in murine hearts predominantly in the scar-muscle junction. Similar results are obtained in human ischemic cardiomyopathy. Fibulin-6 is mostly expressed in close vicinity to vimentin positive cells and is also abundantly expressed in vitro in cultured neonatal CF. TGF-β1 does not induce smooth muscle actin in fibroblasts deficient of fibulin-6, which also compromised their migration. Cells that had migrated expressed more fibulin-6 compared to stationary cells. Plated on fibulin-6 depleted matrix, stress fiber induction in fibroblast in response to TGF-β1 was impaired. In ex vivo explant cultures from postinfarct myocardium, the number of emigrating fibroblasts was also significantly reduced by fibulin-6 siRNA knock down (KD).\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\nFibulin-6, a fibroblast released ECM protein may play an important role during myocardial remodeling by imparting an effect on cardiac fibroblast migration in close and complementary interplay with TGF-β1 signalling.','2014','Jun','20','2014-06-24 20:56:42',NULL,1,1),(323,1,'nick@masomurray.com','24948576','1569-9285','Interactive cardiovascular and thoracic surgery','Computational fluid dynamics of the right ventricular outflow tract and of the pulmonary artery: a bench model of flow dynamics.','© The Author 2014.

The reoperation rate at 5 years can be as high as 25% and depends on age, type of conduit, conduit diameter and principal heart malformation. The aim of this study is to provide a bench model with computer fluid dynamics to analyse the haemodynamics of the RVOT, pulmonary artery, its bifurcation, and left and right pulmonary arteries that in the future may serve as a tool for analysis and prediction of outcome following RVOT reconstruction.\r\nMETHODS:\r\nPressure, flow and diameter at the RVOT, pulmonary artery, bifurcation of the pulmonary artery, and left and right pulmonary arteries were measured in five normal pigs with a mean weight of 24.6 ± 0.89 kg. Data obtained were used for a 3D computer fluid-dynamics simulation of flow conditions, focusing on the pressure, flow and shear stress profile of the pulmonary trunk to the level of the left and right pulmonary arteries.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nThree inlet steady flow profiles were obtained at 0.2, 0.29 and 0.36 m/s that correspond to the flow rates of 1.5, 2.0 and 2.5 l/min flow at the RVOT. The flow velocity profile was constant at the RVOT down to the bifurcation and decreased at the left and right pulmonary arteries. In all three inlet velocity profiles, low sheer stress and low-velocity areas were detected along the left wall of the pulmonary artery, at the pulmonary artery bifurcation and at the ostia of both pulmonary arteries.\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\nThis computed fluid real-time model provides us with a realistic picture of fluid dynamics in the pulmonary tract area. Deep shear stress areas correspond to a turbulent flow profile that is a predictive factor for the development of vessel wall arteriosclerosis.

This prospective study investigated the predictive value of a depressed intraoperative global longitudinal strain (GLS) for postoperative atrial fibrillation after isolated aortic valve replacement in patients with preserved ejection fraction.\r\nMETHODS:\r\nA total of 107 patients with ejection fraction ≥50% and moderate-to-severe aortic stenosis undergoing isolated aortic valve replacement were enrolled. All patients underwent intraoperative transoesophageal echocardiography before surgical incision (T1) and after closure of the sternotomy (T2) with semiautomated measurement of GLS, and were followed for the occurrence of postoperative atrial fibrillation during the hospitalization.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nThe incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation was 37/107 (34.6%). Patients with postoperative atrial fibrillation were associated with increased length of hospitalization and a higher risk of low cardiac output syndrome and pulmonary complications. On univariate analysis, significant risk factors associated with postoperative atrial fibrillation were E/e\' ratio, left atrial volume index (LAVi), GLST2 and ΔGLS%. On multivariable analysis, GLST2 (odds ratio: 1.21; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.06-1.56, P = 0.031) and ΔGLS% (odds ratio: 3.66; 95% CI: 1.85-6.79, P = 0.001) were independent predictors of postoperative atrial fibrillation.

The type of procedure, perioperative antiplatelet therapy, and other patient-related factors influence the risk of postoperative haemorrhage. Our objective was to analyze the postoperative risk factors for hemorrhagic complications and to determine the impact of antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy strategies on postoperative bleeding risk in patients with coronary stents undergoing non-cardiac surgery.\r\nPATIENTS AND METHODS:\r\nProspective, multicentre observational cohort study of 1134 consecutive patients with coronary stents undergoing non-cardiac surgery between April 2007 and April 2009. The primary outcome measure was the occurrence of an hemorrhagic complication during the first 30days following the surgery or intervention.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nAmong the 1134 patients evaluated, 108 (9.5%) experienced a postoperative hemorrhagic complication (with a median time to occurrence of 5.3days). These complications were considered major, involved the operative site, and required reoperation in 92 (85.2%), 92 (85.2%), and 20 (18.5%) of patients, respectively. Mortality in patients with a haemorrhagic complication was 12% (n=13). Independent postoperative factors associated with haemorrhagic complications were identified as a high and intermediate bleeding risk procedure and the use and dose of anticoagulants. When interrupted before the procedure, resumption of antiplatelet treatment was delayed in patients developing early postoperative hemorrhagic complications.\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\nPatients with coronary stents who undergo surgery are at high risk for hemorrhagic complications.','2014','May','15','2014-06-24 20:56:42',NULL,1,1),(328,1,'nick@masomurray.com','24908593','1873-4529','Journal of clinical anesthesia','Anesthetic management and outcomes for patients with pulmonary hypertension and intracardiac shunts and Eisenmenger syndrome: a review of institutional experience.','Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Significant systemic arterial hypotension occurred in 14 individuals (26%) and oxygen desaturation in 9 (17%) patients. Administration of an intravenous (IV) vasopressor agent during induction significantly decreased the incidence of hypotension. The type of IV induction agent did not influence hemodynamic alterations, though patients who received propofol experienced a trend towards increased hypotension (83% of pts) when a vasopressor was not used. Inhalational induction, regardless of vasopressor use, was more likely to result in hypotension (60% of pts). The 30-day mortality was 3.8% (two pts). Both patients had minor elective procedures with monitored anesthesia care (MAC).\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\nHypotension is more common in patients with Eisenmenger syndrome and similar physiology when a vasopressor is not used during the peri-induction period, regardless of induction agent. Etomidate tended to have better hemodynamic stability than other induction agents. The use of a vasopressor is recommended. We present general recommendations for anesthesiologists and strongly recommend use of a vasopressor before or during induction to reduce hypotension along with complete avoidance of inhalational induction. Further, MAC anesthesia has been associated with perioperative and 30-day mortality.','2014','Jun','4','2014-06-24 20:56:42',NULL,1,1),(329,1,'nick@masomurray.com','24906370','2047-9980','Journal of the American Heart Association','Assessment of a university of california, los angeles 4-variable risk score for advanced heart failure.','© 2014 The Authors.

The outcome was survival free from urgent transplantation or LVAD. The model-predicted survival was compared to Kaplan-Meier\'s estimated survival at 1, 2, and 3 years. Model discrimination and calibration were assessed. During a mean follow-up of 2.1 years, 37 (21%) events occurred. One-, 2- and 3-year observed event-free survival was 88%, 81%, and 75%, and the observed/predicted ratio was 0.97, 0.96, and 0.97, respectively. Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curve analyses demonstrated good discrimination overall (1-year area under curve, 0.801; 2-year, 0.774; 3-year, 0.837), but discrimination between the 2 highest risk groups was poor. The difference between observed and predicted survival ranged from -14 to +17 percentage points, suggesting poor model calibration. Fairly similar results were found when the analyses were repeated in 715 patients after multivariate imputation of missing data.\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\nThe UCLA 4-variable risk model calibration was inconsistent and high-risk discrimination was poor in an external validation cohort.

Additionally, diabetes is also an important pathogenic factor for the emergence of cognitive dysfunction. If patient is suffering from diabetes, the incidence of cognitive dysfunction greatly increased. We therefore aimed to investigate the effects of isoflurane anesthesia on cognitive dysfunction in a diabetic rat model induced by a single injection of streptozotocin (STZ). Wistar rats received 2 h of 2% isoflurane or oxygen exposure 1 month after a single intraperitoneal injection of 60 mg/kg of STZ or the vehicle. The results showed that isoflurane anesthesia significantly aggravates STZ-induced an increase of the latency to the platform and a decrease of the proportion of time spent in the target quadrant of rats in Morris water maze test. In addition to the expression of amyloid-β (Aβ), superoxide dismutase (SOD), malonyldialdehyde (MDA), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β), isoflurane anesthesia significantly increased as compared with a single injection of STZ. However, isoflurane anesthesia had no effect on the blood glucose and leptin. In conclusion, our results suggested that isoflurane anesthesia aggravating cognitive impairment induced by STZ is probably related to the activation of oxidative stress and inflammatory response in rat hippocampus.','2014','','','2014-06-24 20:56:47',NULL,1,1),(348,2,'nickm@masomurray.com','24955151','1940-5901','International journal of clinical and experimental medicine','Pre-emptive small dose of fentanyl suppresses fentanyl-induced cough: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.','','Fentanyl-induced cough (FIC) should be effectively prevented in patients requiring stable induction of general anesthesia.

Use of these catheters as a continuous monitor, however, is fraught with complexities and limitations.\r\nMETHODS:\r\nExamples of the limitations and optimal use of conductance catheters as a continuous, real-time monitor of cardiovascular function are demonstrated during inotropic drug infusion in anesthetised rats.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nInotropic drug infusion may alter ventricular dimensions causing relative movement of a well-positioned catheter, generating artifacts, including an abrupt pressure rise at end-systole that leads to over estimation of indices of contractility (max dP/dt) and loss of stroke volume signal. Simple rotation of the catheter, echocardiography-guided placement to the centre of the ventricle, or ventricular expansion through crystalloid infusion may correct for these artifacts. Fluid administration, however, alters left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and volume and therefore stroke volume, thereby obscuring continuous real-time haemodynamic measurements.\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\nPressure-volume artifacts during inotropic infusion are caused by physical contact of the catheter with endocardium.

Age, previous cardiovascular events and high pneumonia severity index were independent predictors of myocardial infarction; clinical predictors of stroke were not identified.

Biological plausibility of such association may be deduced by experimental and clinical studies, showing that lung infection is complicated by platelet aggregation and clotting system activation, as documented by up-regulation of Tissue Factor and down-regulation of activated Protein C. The effect of antithrombotic drugs have been examined in experimental and clinical studies but results are still inconclusive. Thrombotic-related vascular disease such as myocardial infarction, stroke and venous thrombosis may complicate the clinical course of pneumonia and worsen its prognosis.

Mast cell carboxypeptidase A (MC-CPA) is released solely from MCs and plays a critical role in degrading toxins and endothelin 1 (ET-1). The present study sought to explore whether MC-CPA is involved in the process of IPC in a rodent model of small intestinal ischemia reperfusion (IIR) injury.\r\nMATERIALS AND METHODS:\r\nIIR injuries were induced in Sprague-Dawley rats by clamping the superior mesenteric artery for 60 min followed by reperfusion for 2 h. One cycle of 10 min intestinal ischemia and 10 min of reperfusion was used in the IPC group, and the MC stabilizer cromolyn sodium and MC potato carboxypeptidase inhibitor were administered before the start of IPC. At the end of experiment, intestine tissue was obtained for assays of the MC-CPA3, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, and ET-1 contents and myeloperoxidase activities. Intestinal histologic injury scores and MC degranulation were assessed. Apoptosis indices and cleaved caspase- 3 protein expressions were quantified.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nIIR resulted in severe injury, as evidenced by significant increases in injury scores and MC-CPA3, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, and ET-1 contents that were accompanied with concomitant elevations in cleaved caspase 3 expression, apoptosis indices, and myeloperoxidase activities. IPC induced a significant increase in MC-CPA3, induced MC degranulation, and attenuated IIR injury by downregulating IIR-induced biochemical changes, whereas cromolyn sodium and potato carboxypeptidase inhibitor abolished the IPC-mediated changes.\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\nThese data suggest that IPC protected against IIR injury via the MC degranulation-mediated release of MC-CPA.','2014','May','23','2014-06-24 20:56:47',NULL,1,1),(360,2,'nickm@masomurray.com','24953890','1523-6838','American journal of kidney diseases : the official journal of the National Kidney Foundation','Serum Bicarbonate Concentrations and Kidney Disease Progression in Community-Living Elders: The Health, Aging, and Body Composition (Health ABC) Study.','Published by Elsevier Inc.','\r\nBACKGROUND:\r\nIn populations with prevalent chronic kidney disease (CKD), lower serum bicarbonate levels are associated with more rapid CKD progression, but whether lower bicarbonate levels also are associated with risk of incident estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)\r\nSTUDY DESIGN:\r\nLongitudinal observational cohort study.\r\nSETTING & PARTICIPANTS:\r\nWell-functioning community-living elders aged 70-79 years at inception.\r\nPREDICTOR:\r\nSerum bicarbonate level measured at the time of collection by arterialized venous blood sample using an arterial blood gas analyzer.\r\nOUTCOMES:\r\nChange in eGFR over 7 years, and new eGFR\r\nMEASUREMENTS:\r\nLinear and logistic regressions were used to evaluate associations of baseline serum bicarbonate level with change in eGFR and incident eGFR\r\nRESULTS:\r\nAt baseline, mean eGFR was 84±16 (SD)mL/min/1.73m(2), and serum bicarbonate level was 25.2±1.9mmol/L.

The present study aimed to define the role of FoxO1 in the regulation of NaV1.5 expression and cardiac Na(+) channel activity in mouse ventricular cardiomyocytes and assess the cardiac electrophysiological phenotype of mice with cardiac FoxO1 deletion. Tamoxifen-induced and cardiac-specific FoxO1 deletion was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Cardiac FoxO1 deletion failed to result in either cardiac functional changes or hypertrophy as assessed by echocardiography and individual ventricular cell capacitances, respectively. Western blotting showed that FoxO1 was significantly decreased while NaV1.5 protein level was significantly increased in mouse hearts with FoxO1 deletion. Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) revealed that FoxO1 deletion led to an increase in NaV1.5 and Na(+) channel subunit β3 mRNA, but not β1, 2, 4, or connexin 43. Whole patch-clamp recordings demonstrated that cardiac Na(+) currents were significantly augmented by FoxO1 deletion without affecting the steady-state activation and inactivation, leading to accelerated depolarization of action potentials in mouse ventricular cardiomyocytes. Electrocardiogram recordings showed that the QRS complex was significantly shortened and P wave amplitude was significantly increased in conscious and unrestrained mice with cardiac FoxO1 deletion. NaV1.5 expression was decreased in the peri-infarct (border-zone) of mice with myocardial infarction and FoxO1 accumulated in the cardiomyocyte nuclei of chronic ischemic human hearts.

The Functional Disability Inventory and a Numeric Rating Scale of average pain intensity were completed by the child at every CBT session. Hierarchical linear modeling was conducted to examine the longitudinal trajectories of disability and pain. Standardized estimates of the slopes of change were obtained to test differences in rates of change between pain and disability. Results showed an overall significant decline in functional disability over time. While pain scores reduced slightly from pre- to post-treatment, the longitudinal decline over treatment was not statistically significant. As expected, the rate of change of disability was significantly more rapid than pain. Evidence for variability in treatment response was noted suggesting the need for additional research into individual trajectories of change in pediatric pain treatment.','2014','Jun','19','2014-06-24 20:56:50',NULL,1,1),(367,3,'blindmurray@gmail.com','24953887','1528-8447','The journal of pain : official journal of the American Pain Society','The economic costs of chronic pain among a cohort of treatment seeking adolescents in the United States.','Copyright © 2014 American Pain Society.

However, the minimal blood volume for effective processing under clinically relevant conditions has yet to be determined.\r\nSTUDY DESIGN AND METHODS:\r\nFresh blood from volunteer donations adjusted to a hematocrit (Hct) of 10% was used to test ELECTA (Sorin) equipped with a 55-mL bowl, C.A.T.S (Fresenius) in the pediatric program mode, and OrthoPAT (Haemonetics). Twenty-milliliter portions of red blood cells (RBCs) were added and processed under various conditions, including clinically relevant first filling and intermittent emptying. RBC recovery and availability and plasma elimination were calculated from the Hct, free hemoglobin, and total protein.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nThe main impediment to recovery and availability was the first filling. There, RBC recovery was significantly reduced, while it subsequently varied between 93 and 98%. To produce the first 30 mL of RBCs, ELECTA required 42 mL and C.A.T.S and OrthoPAT 62 mL owing to the dead space of the separation chamber or reservoir, respectively. RBC availability was much higher in subsequent processes, with only minimal differences between the three devices. They all consistently provided high plasma elimination rates.\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\nThe continuous system showed no advantage over a small Latham bowl. From the results it can be calculated that the limit for feasible cell salvage at present is an infant of 6 months.

These studies have raised significant safety concerns regarding the use of anesthetics in the pediatric population and highlight the need for a better model to study anesthetic-induced neurotoxicity in humans. Human embryonic stem cells are capable of differentiating into any cell type and represent a promising model to study mechanisms governing anesthetic-induced neurotoxicity.\r\nMETHODS::\r\nCell death in human embryonic stem cell-derived neurons was assessed using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate in situ nick end labeling staining, and microRNA expression was assessed using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. miR-21 was overexpressed and knocked down using an miR-21 mimic and antagomir, respectively. Sprouty 2 was knocked down using a small interfering RNA, and the expression of the miR-21 targets of interest was assessed by Western blot.\r\nRESULTS::\r\nPropofol dose and exposure time dependently induced significant cell death (n = 3) in the neurons and down-regulated several microRNAs, including miR-21. Overexpression of miR-21 and knockdown of Sprouty 2 attenuated the increase in terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate in situ nick end labeling-positive cells following propofol exposure. In addition, miR-21 knockdown increased the number of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate in situ nick end labeling-positive cells by 30% (n = 5).

Methods : The records of patients operated on for a perforated duodenal ulcer in the last 8 years in two pediatric surgery centers were evaluated retrospectively. Patient demographics, symptoms, time to admission to hospital, operative findings, and postoperative clinical course were evaluated. Results : Nine children (mean age 13.2 years, range 6-170 years) were included. All patients were admitted in the first six hours after their abdominal pain started. In three patients, there was free air on plain x-rays, while the x-rays were normal in six. All perforations were located on the anterior surface of the first part of the duodenum and repaired with primary suturing and Graham patch omentoplasty. The recovery was uneventful in all patients. In five patients, urea breath tests were performed postoperatively for Helicobacter Pylori, and the results were positive. All patients underwent triple therapy with lansoprazole, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin. The mean follow-up time was 58 (range 3-94) months.

We investigated the molecular changes associated with acquired hormono-resistances in patient-derived xenografts of LBC. Experimental design: Two LBC xenografts (HBCx22 and HBCx34) were treated with different endocrine therapies (ET) to obtain xenografts with acquired resistances to tamoxifen (TamR) and ovariectomy (OvaR). PI3K pathway activation was analyzed by western blot and immunohistochemistry and responses to ET combined to everolimus were investigated in vivo. Gene expression analyses were performed by RT-PCR and Affymetrix arrays. Results: HBCx22 TamR xenograft was cross-resistant to several hormono-therapies, while HBCx22 OvaR and HBCx34 TamR exhibited a treatment specific resistance profile. PI3K pathway was similarly activated in parental and resistant xenografts but the addition of everolimus didn\'t restore the response to tamoxifen in TamR xenografts. By contrast, the combination of fulvestrant and everolimus induced tumor regression in vivo in HBCx34 TamR, where we found a cross-talk between ER and PI3K pathways. Expression of several ER-controlled genes and ER co-regulators was significantly changed in both TamR and OvaR tumors, indicating impaired ER transcriptional activity. Expression changes associated with hormono-resistance were both tumor and treatment specific and were enriched for genes involved in cell growth, cell death and cell survival. Conclusions: PDX models of LBC with acquired resistance to endocrine therapies show a great diversity of resistance phenotype, associated to specific deregulations of ER-mediated gene transcription. These models offer a tool for developing anticancer therapies and to investigate the dynamics of resistance emerging during pharmacological interventions.','2014','Jun','19','2014-06-24 20:56:50',NULL,1,1),(379,3,'blindmurray@gmail.com','24947863','1439-0531','Reproduction in domestic animals = Zuchthygiene','Causes, diagnosis and therapy of common diseases in neonatal puppies in the first days of life: cornerstones of practical approach.','© 2014 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.','Neonatal diseases and losses are a common and often unavoidable problem within breeding kennels. Altogether, morbidity and mortality ranges, according to the literature, from 5 to 35%.

Approximately 90% of all deaths in hypoxaemic pups occur during the first 2 days. Of 183 pups with hypoxia, 63 died, 92.7% of them within 48 h after birth. Among infectious causes, bacterial infection is the most common cause of neonatal mortality.

The pathophysiology remains unclear, although evidence exists that surgical trauma and the use of cardiopulmonary bypass provoke an immune response leading to PPS. We hypothesized that an intraoperative dose of dexamethasone decreases the risk of PPS, by reducing this inflammatory response.\r\nMETHODS:\r\nWe performed a subanalysis of the DECS study, which is a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial of 4,494 patients undergoing cardiac surgery with use of cardiopulmonary bypass. The aim of the DECS study was to investigate whether a single intraoperative dose of 1 mg/kg dexamethasone reduced the incidence of a composite of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, renal failure, or respiratory failure, within 30 days of randomization. In this substudy, we retrospectively analyzed the occurrence of PPS in 822 patients who were included in the DECS trial and underwent valvular surgery.

Fibulin-6, an ECM protein is expressed in cell junctions particularly in tissues subjected to significant mechanical stress. Fibulin-6 deficiency results in defective cell migration in nematodes and early embryonic lethality in mice. The role of fibulin-6 in healthy and failing myocardium has not been described. We have examined the expression and distribution pattern of fibulin-6 during myocardial remodeling (MR) and detailed its effect on the migratory function of cardiac fibroblasts (CF) in response to TGF-β1.\r\nMETHODS AND RESULTS:\r\nIn healthy murine myocardium fibulin-6 expression is largely confined to larger coronary arteries. It is induced during the early and the late phase of remodeling after infarction in murine hearts predominantly in the scar-muscle junction. Similar results are obtained in human ischemic cardiomyopathy. Fibulin-6 is mostly expressed in close vicinity to vimentin positive cells and is also abundantly expressed in vitro in cultured neonatal CF. TGF-β1 does not induce smooth muscle actin in fibroblasts deficient of fibulin-6, which also compromised their migration. Cells that had migrated expressed more fibulin-6 compared to stationary cells. Plated on fibulin-6 depleted matrix, stress fiber induction in fibroblast in response to TGF-β1 was impaired. In ex vivo explant cultures from postinfarct myocardium, the number of emigrating fibroblasts was also significantly reduced by fibulin-6 siRNA knock down (KD).\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\nFibulin-6, a fibroblast released ECM protein may play an important role during myocardial remodeling by imparting an effect on cardiac fibroblast migration in close and complementary interplay with TGF-β1 signalling.','2014','Jun','20','2014-06-24 20:58:46',NULL,1,1),(383,1,'nick@masomurray.com','24948576','1569-9285','Interactive cardiovascular and thoracic surgery','Computational fluid dynamics of the right ventricular outflow tract and of the pulmonary artery: a bench model of flow dynamics.','© The Author 2014.

In all three inlet velocity profiles, low sheer stress and low-velocity areas were detected along the left wall of the pulmonary artery, at the pulmonary artery bifurcation and at the ostia of both pulmonary arteries.\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\nThis computed fluid real-time model provides us with a realistic picture of fluid dynamics in the pulmonary tract area. Deep shear stress areas correspond to a turbulent flow profile that is a predictive factor for the development of vessel wall arteriosclerosis. We believe that this bench model may be a useful tool for further evaluation of RVOT pathology following surgical reconstructions.','2014','Jun','19','2014-06-24 20:58:46',NULL,1,1),(384,1,'nick@masomurray.com','24937347','1526-7598','Anesthesia and analgesia','The Long-Term Impact of Early Cardiovascular Therapy Intensification for Postoperative Troponin Elevation after Major Vascular Surgery.','','\r\nBACKGROUND::\r\nAcute cardiac events are a frequent cause of morbidity after vascular surgery. The impact of early evidence-based treatment for patients with an acute cardiac event after vascular surgery on long-term postoperative outcomes has not been extensively studied. We hypothesized that providing appropriate evidence-based treatment to patients with elevated postoperative cardiac troponin levels may limit long-term mortality.\r\nMETHODS::\r\nWe conducted a study of 667 consecutive major vascular surgery patients with an elevated postoperative troponin I level. We then determined which of these patients received medical therapy as per the 2007 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association recommendations for the medical management of patients with chronic stable angina. All patients with troponin elevation were then matched with 2 control patients without postoperative troponin elevation. Matching was done using logistic regression and nearest-neighbor matching methods. The primary study end point was 12 months survival without a major cardiac event (i.e., death, myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, or pulmonary edema requiring hospitalization).\r\nRESULTS::\r\nTherapy was intensified in 43 of 66 patients (65%) who suffered a troponin I elevation after surgery. Patients with a troponin I elevation not receiving intensified cardiovascular treatment had a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.77 (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.13-2.42; P = 0.004) for the primary study outcome as compared with the control group. In contrast, patients with a troponin I elevation who received intensified cardiovascular treatment had an HR of 0.63 (95% CI, 0.10-1.19; P = 0.45) for the primary outcome as compared with the control group. Patients with a troponin I elevation not receiving treatment intensification likely were at higher risk for a major cardiac event (HR, 2.80; 95% CI, 1.05-24.2; P = 0.04) compared with patients who did receive treatment intensification.\r\nCONCLUSIONS::\r\nThe main finding of this study was that in patients with elevated troponin I levels after noncardiac surgery, long-term adverse cardiac outcomes may likely be improved by following evidence-based recommendations for the medical management of acute coronary syndromes.','2014','Jun','16','2014-06-24 20:58:46',NULL,1,1),(385,1,'nick@masomurray.com','24937201','2329-0358','Annals of transplantation : quarterly of the Polish Transplantation Society','Comparative analysis of the quality of life for patients prior to and after heart transplantation.','','Background The aim of this study was to assess the quality of life of patients before and after heart transplantation (HTX).

This prospective study investigated the predictive value of a depressed intraoperative global longitudinal strain (GLS) for postoperative atrial fibrillation after isolated aortic valve replacement in patients with preserved ejection fraction.\r\nMETHODS:\r\nA total of 107 patients with ejection fraction ≥50% and moderate-to-severe aortic stenosis undergoing isolated aortic valve replacement were enrolled. All patients underwent intraoperative transoesophageal echocardiography before surgical incision (T1) and after closure of the sternotomy (T2) with semiautomated measurement of GLS, and were followed for the occurrence of postoperative atrial fibrillation during the hospitalization.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nThe incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation was 37/107 (34.6%). Patients with postoperative atrial fibrillation were associated with increased length of hospitalization and a higher risk of low cardiac output syndrome and pulmonary complications.

The type of procedure, perioperative antiplatelet therapy, and other patient-related factors influence the risk of postoperative haemorrhage. Our objective was to analyze the postoperative risk factors for hemorrhagic complications and to determine the impact of antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy strategies on postoperative bleeding risk in patients with coronary stents undergoing non-cardiac surgery.\r\nPATIENTS AND METHODS:\r\nProspective, multicentre observational cohort study of 1134 consecutive patients with coronary stents undergoing non-cardiac surgery between April 2007 and April 2009. The primary outcome measure was the occurrence of an hemorrhagic complication during the first 30days following the surgery or intervention.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nAmong the 1134 patients evaluated, 108 (9.5%) experienced a postoperative hemorrhagic complication (with a median time to occurrence of 5.3days). These complications were considered major, involved the operative site, and required reoperation in 92 (85.2%), 92 (85.2%), and 20 (18.5%) of patients, respectively. Mortality in patients with a haemorrhagic complication was 12% (n=13). Independent postoperative factors associated with haemorrhagic complications were identified as a high and intermediate bleeding risk procedure and the use and dose of anticoagulants. When interrupted before the procedure, resumption of antiplatelet treatment was delayed in patients developing early postoperative hemorrhagic complications.\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\nPatients with coronary stents who undergo surgery are at high risk for hemorrhagic complications.','2014','May','15','2014-06-24 20:58:46',NULL,1,1),(388,1,'nick@masomurray.com','24908593','1873-4529','Journal of clinical anesthesia','Anesthetic management and outcomes for patients with pulmonary hypertension and intracardiac shunts and Eisenmenger syndrome: a review of institutional experience.','Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Significant systemic arterial hypotension occurred in 14 individuals (26%) and oxygen desaturation in 9 (17%) patients. Administration of an intravenous (IV) vasopressor agent during induction significantly decreased the incidence of hypotension. The type of IV induction agent did not influence hemodynamic alterations, though patients who received propofol experienced a trend towards increased hypotension (83% of pts) when a vasopressor was not used. Inhalational induction, regardless of vasopressor use, was more likely to result in hypotension (60% of pts). The 30-day mortality was 3.8% (two pts). Both patients had minor elective procedures with monitored anesthesia care (MAC).\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\nHypotension is more common in patients with Eisenmenger syndrome and similar physiology when a vasopressor is not used during the peri-induction period, regardless of induction agent. Etomidate tended to have better hemodynamic stability than other induction agents. The use of a vasopressor is recommended. We present general recommendations for anesthesiologists and strongly recommend use of a vasopressor before or during induction to reduce hypotension along with complete avoidance of inhalational induction. Further, MAC anesthesia has been associated with perioperative and 30-day mortality.','2014','Jun','4','2014-06-24 20:58:46',NULL,1,1),(389,1,'nick@masomurray.com','24906370','2047-9980','Journal of the American Heart Association','Assessment of a university of california, los angeles 4-variable risk score for advanced heart failure.','© 2014 The Authors.

The outcome was survival free from urgent transplantation or LVAD. The model-predicted survival was compared to Kaplan-Meier\'s estimated survival at 1, 2, and 3 years. Model discrimination and calibration were assessed. During a mean follow-up of 2.1 years, 37 (21%) events occurred.

The difference between observed and predicted survival ranged from -14 to +17 percentage points, suggesting poor model calibration. Fairly similar results were found when the analyses were repeated in 715 patients after multivariate imputation of missing data.\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\nThe UCLA 4-variable risk model calibration was inconsistent and high-risk discrimination was poor in an external validation cohort.

If patient is suffering from diabetes, the incidence of cognitive dysfunction greatly increased. We therefore aimed to investigate the effects of isoflurane anesthesia on cognitive dysfunction in a diabetic rat model induced by a single injection of streptozotocin (STZ). Wistar rats received 2 h of 2% isoflurane or oxygen exposure 1 month after a single intraperitoneal injection of 60 mg/kg of STZ or the vehicle.

In addition to the expression of amyloid-β (Aβ), superoxide dismutase (SOD), malonyldialdehyde (MDA), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β), isoflurane anesthesia significantly increased as compared with a single injection of STZ.

Simple rotation of the catheter, echocardiography-guided placement to the centre of the ventricle, or ventricular expansion through crystalloid infusion may correct for these artifacts. Fluid administration, however, alters left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and volume and therefore stroke volume, thereby obscuring continuous real-time haemodynamic measurements.\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\nPressure-volume artifacts during inotropic infusion are caused by physical contact of the catheter with endocardium.

Epidemiological studies have shown that respiratory tract infections are associated with an increased risk of thrombotic-related vascular disease such as myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke and venous thrombosis. Myocardial infarction and stroke have been detected essentially in the early phase of the disease, i.e. within 48 hours from hospital admission, with an incidence ranging from as low as 1% to as high as 11%. Age, previous cardiovascular events and high pneumonia severity index were independent predictors of myocardial infarction; clinical predictors of stroke were not identified. Deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism may also occur after pneumonia but incidence and clinical predictors must be defined. Biological plausibility of such association may be deduced by experimental and clinical studies, showing that lung infection is complicated by platelet aggregation and clotting system activation, as documented by up-regulation of Tissue Factor and down-regulation of activated Protein C. The effect of antithrombotic drugs have been examined in experimental and clinical studies but results are still inconclusive. Thrombotic-related vascular disease such as myocardial infarction, stroke and venous thrombosis may complicate the clinical course of pneumonia and worsen its prognosis. Further definition of predictors may help to identify patients at higher risk of artery and venous thrombosis.

However, treatment programs for chronic pain typically take a rehabilitative approach, emphasizing decreasing pain-related disability first with the expectation that pain reduction will follow. This information is routinely provided to patients yet no studies have systematically examined the actual trajectories of pain and disability in a clinical care setting. In this study of youth with chronic pain (N=94, 8-18 years), it was hypothesized that 1) functional disability and pain would decrease over the course of psychological treatment for chronic pain and 2) functional disability would decrease more quickly than pain intensity. Participants received cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for pain management (M = 5.6 sessions) plus standard medical care. The Functional Disability Inventory and a Numeric Rating Scale of average pain intensity were completed by the child at every CBT session. Hierarchical linear modeling was conducted to examine the longitudinal trajectories of disability and pain. Standardized estimates of the slopes of change were obtained to test differences in rates of change between pain and disability. Results showed an overall significant decline in functional disability over time. While pain scores reduced slightly from pre- to post-treatment, the longitudinal decline over treatment was not statistically significant. As expected, the rate of change of disability was significantly more rapid than pain. Evidence for variability in treatment response was noted suggesting the need for additional research into individual trajectories of change in pediatric pain treatment.','2014','Jun','19','2014-06-24 20:58:50',NULL,1,1),(417,2,'nickm@masomurray.com','24954125','1769-6623','Annales francaises d\'anesthesie et de reanimation','[MP Veran\'s report on hospital interim work: An incomplete and biased assessment (or how to miscount people and deny their professionalism).]','','','2014','Jun','19','2014-06-24 20:58:50',NULL,1,1),(418,2,'nickm@masomurray.com','24954016','1533-2500','Pain practice : the official journal of World Institute of Pain','Comparison of High-voltage- with Standard-voltage Pulsed Radiofrequency of Gasserian Ganglion in the Treatment of Idiopathic Trigeminal Neuralgia.','© 2014 World Institute of Pain.','Although pulsed radiofrequency treatment (PRFT) has been used to treat trigeminal neuralgia (TN) safely, satisfactory improvement is lacking.

Mast cell carboxypeptidase A (MC-CPA) is released solely from MCs and plays a critical role in degrading toxins and endothelin 1 (ET-1). The present study sought to explore whether MC-CPA is involved in the process of IPC in a rodent model of small intestinal ischemia reperfusion (IIR) injury.\r\nMATERIALS AND METHODS:\r\nIIR injuries were induced in Sprague-Dawley rats by clamping the superior mesenteric artery for 60 min followed by reperfusion for 2 h. One cycle of 10 min intestinal ischemia and 10 min of reperfusion was used in the IPC group, and the MC stabilizer cromolyn sodium and MC potato carboxypeptidase inhibitor were administered before the start of IPC. At the end of experiment, intestine tissue was obtained for assays of the MC-CPA3, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, and ET-1 contents and myeloperoxidase activities. Intestinal histologic injury scores and MC degranulation were assessed. Apoptosis indices and cleaved caspase- 3 protein expressions were quantified.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nIIR resulted in severe injury, as evidenced by significant increases in injury scores and MC-CPA3, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, and ET-1 contents that were accompanied with concomitant elevations in cleaved caspase 3 expression, apoptosis indices, and myeloperoxidase activities. IPC induced a significant increase in MC-CPA3, induced MC degranulation, and attenuated IIR injury by downregulating IIR-induced biochemical changes, whereas cromolyn sodium and potato carboxypeptidase inhibitor abolished the IPC-mediated changes.\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\nThese data suggest that IPC protected against IIR injury via the MC degranulation-mediated release of MC-CPA.','2014','May','23','2014-06-24 20:58:50',NULL,1,1),(420,2,'nickm@masomurray.com','24953890','1523-6838','American journal of kidney diseases : the official journal of the National Kidney Foundation','Serum Bicarbonate Concentrations and Kidney Disease Progression in Community-Living Elders: The Health, Aging, and Body Composition (Health ABC) Study.','Published by Elsevier Inc.','\r\nBACKGROUND:\r\nIn populations with prevalent chronic kidney disease (CKD), lower serum bicarbonate levels are associated with more rapid CKD progression, but whether lower bicarbonate levels also are associated with risk of incident estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)\r\nSTUDY DESIGN:\r\nLongitudinal observational cohort study.\r\nSETTING & PARTICIPANTS:\r\nWell-functioning community-living elders aged 70-79 years at inception.\r\nPREDICTOR:\r\nSerum bicarbonate level measured at the time of collection by arterialized venous blood sample using an arterial blood gas analyzer.\r\nOUTCOMES:\r\nChange in eGFR over 7 years, and new eGFR\r\nMEASUREMENTS:\r\nLinear and logistic regressions were used to evaluate associations of baseline serum bicarbonate level with change in eGFR and incident eGFR\r\nRESULTS:\r\nAt baseline, mean eGFR was 84±16 (SD)mL/min/1.73m(2), and serum bicarbonate level was 25.2±1.9mmol/L.

The in vivo role of FoxO1 in the regulation of cardiac NaV1.5 expression remains unknown. The present study aimed to define the role of FoxO1 in the regulation of NaV1.5 expression and cardiac Na(+) channel activity in mouse ventricular cardiomyocytes and assess the cardiac electrophysiological phenotype of mice with cardiac FoxO1 deletion. Tamoxifen-induced and cardiac-specific FoxO1 deletion was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Cardiac FoxO1 deletion failed to result in either cardiac functional changes or hypertrophy as assessed by echocardiography and individual ventricular cell capacitances, respectively. Western blotting showed that FoxO1 was significantly decreased while NaV1.5 protein level was significantly increased in mouse hearts with FoxO1 deletion. Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) revealed that FoxO1 deletion led to an increase in NaV1.5 and Na(+) channel subunit β3 mRNA, but not β1, 2, 4, or connexin 43. Whole patch-clamp recordings demonstrated that cardiac Na(+) currents were significantly augmented by FoxO1 deletion without affecting the steady-state activation and inactivation, leading to accelerated depolarization of action potentials in mouse ventricular cardiomyocytes. Electrocardiogram recordings showed that the QRS complex was significantly shortened and P wave amplitude was significantly increased in conscious and unrestrained mice with cardiac FoxO1 deletion. NaV1.5 expression was decreased in the peri-infarct (border-zone) of mice with myocardial infarction and FoxO1 accumulated in the cardiomyocyte nuclei of chronic ischemic human hearts.

Ovariectomized, estrogen-primed rats (5 μg estradiol benzoate 40 hr earlier) were injected intraventricularly with the above-mentioned compounds, or they received VCS. All compounds and VCS effectively facilitated estrous behavior when tested at 60, 120 or 240 min after infusion or application of VCS. Intraventricular infusion of tamoxifen (5 μg), 30 min prior, significantly attenuated estrous behaviors induced in estradiol-primed rats by P, most of its 5α- and 5β-reduced metabolites, GnRH, and PGE2, but not by VCS. Although there was a trend for reduction, tamoxifen did not significantly decrease lordosis in females treated with 5β-pregnan-3,20-dione. ICI also inhibited lordosis behavior induced by P and GnRH at some testing intervals. These results suggest that activation of classical ERs participates in the triggering effects on estrous behavior induced by agents with different chemical structures that do not bind directly to ERs.','2014','Jun','19','2014-06-24 20:58:54',NULL,1,1),(426,3,'blindmurray@gmail.com','24954165','1872-6623','Pain','Differential changes in functional disability and pain intensity over the course of psychological treatment for children with chronic pain.','Copyright © 2014. Published by Elsevier B.V.','Patients presenting for treatment of chronic pain often believe that pain reduction must be achieved before returning to normal functioning. However, treatment programs for chronic pain typically take a rehabilitative approach, emphasizing decreasing pain-related disability first with the expectation that pain reduction will follow. This information is routinely provided to patients yet no studies have systematically examined the actual trajectories of pain and disability in a clinical care setting. In this study of youth with chronic pain (N=94, 8-18 years), it was hypothesized that 1) functional disability and pain would decrease over the course of psychological treatment for chronic pain and 2) functional disability would decrease more quickly than pain intensity. Participants received cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for pain management (M = 5.6 sessions) plus standard medical care. The Functional Disability Inventory and a Numeric Rating Scale of average pain intensity were completed by the child at every CBT session. Hierarchical linear modeling was conducted to examine the longitudinal trajectories of disability and pain. Standardized estimates of the slopes of change were obtained to test differences in rates of change between pain and disability. Results showed an overall significant decline in functional disability over time. While pain scores reduced slightly from pre- to post-treatment, the longitudinal decline over treatment was not statistically significant. As expected, the rate of change of disability was significantly more rapid than pain. Evidence for variability in treatment response was noted suggesting the need for additional research into individual trajectories of change in pediatric pain treatment.','2014','Jun','19','2014-06-24 20:58:54',NULL,1,1),(427,3,'blindmurray@gmail.com','24953887','1528-8447','The journal of pain : official journal of the American Pain Society','The economic costs of chronic pain among a cohort of treatment seeking adolescents in the United States.','Copyright © 2014 American Pain Society.

However, the minimal blood volume for effective processing under clinically relevant conditions has yet to be determined.\r\nSTUDY DESIGN AND METHODS:\r\nFresh blood from volunteer donations adjusted to a hematocrit (Hct) of 10% was used to test ELECTA (Sorin) equipped with a 55-mL bowl, C.A.T.S (Fresenius) in the pediatric program mode, and OrthoPAT (Haemonetics). Twenty-milliliter portions of red blood cells (RBCs) were added and processed under various conditions, including clinically relevant first filling and intermittent emptying. RBC recovery and availability and plasma elimination were calculated from the Hct, free hemoglobin, and total protein.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nThe main impediment to recovery and availability was the first filling. There, RBC recovery was significantly reduced, while it subsequently varied between 93 and 98%. To produce the first 30 mL of RBCs, ELECTA required 42 mL and C.A.T.S and OrthoPAT 62 mL owing to the dead space of the separation chamber or reservoir, respectively. RBC availability was much higher in subsequent processes, with only minimal differences between the three devices. They all consistently provided high plasma elimination rates.\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\nThe continuous system showed no advantage over a small Latham bowl. From the results it can be calculated that the limit for feasible cell salvage at present is an infant of 6 months.

These studies have raised significant safety concerns regarding the use of anesthetics in the pediatric population and highlight the need for a better model to study anesthetic-induced neurotoxicity in humans. Human embryonic stem cells are capable of differentiating into any cell type and represent a promising model to study mechanisms governing anesthetic-induced neurotoxicity.\r\nMETHODS::\r\nCell death in human embryonic stem cell-derived neurons was assessed using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate in situ nick end labeling staining, and microRNA expression was assessed using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. miR-21 was overexpressed and knocked down using an miR-21 mimic and antagomir, respectively. Sprouty 2 was knocked down using a small interfering RNA, and the expression of the miR-21 targets of interest was assessed by Western blot.\r\nRESULTS::\r\nPropofol dose and exposure time dependently induced significant cell death (n = 3) in the neurons and down-regulated several microRNAs, including miR-21.

Methods : The records of patients operated on for a perforated duodenal ulcer in the last 8 years in two pediatric surgery centers were evaluated retrospectively. Patient demographics, symptoms, time to admission to hospital, operative findings, and postoperative clinical course were evaluated. Results : Nine children (mean age 13.2 years, range 6-170 years) were included. All patients were admitted in the first six hours after their abdominal pain started.

We investigated the molecular changes associated with acquired hormono-resistances in patient-derived xenografts of LBC. Experimental design: Two LBC xenografts (HBCx22 and HBCx34) were treated with different endocrine therapies (ET) to obtain xenografts with acquired resistances to tamoxifen (TamR) and ovariectomy (OvaR). PI3K pathway activation was analyzed by western blot and immunohistochemistry and responses to ET combined to everolimus were investigated in vivo. Gene expression analyses were performed by RT-PCR and Affymetrix arrays. Results: HBCx22 TamR xenograft was cross-resistant to several hormono-therapies, while HBCx22 OvaR and HBCx34 TamR exhibited a treatment specific resistance profile. PI3K pathway was similarly activated in parental and resistant xenografts but the addition of everolimus didn\'t restore the response to tamoxifen in TamR xenografts. By contrast, the combination of fulvestrant and everolimus induced tumor regression in vivo in HBCx34 TamR, where we found a cross-talk between ER and PI3K pathways. Expression of several ER-controlled genes and ER co-regulators was significantly changed in both TamR and OvaR tumors, indicating impaired ER transcriptional activity. Expression changes associated with hormono-resistance were both tumor and treatment specific and were enriched for genes involved in cell growth, cell death and cell survival. Conclusions: PDX models of LBC with acquired resistance to endocrine therapies show a great diversity of resistance phenotype, associated to specific deregulations of ER-mediated gene transcription.

Approximately 90% of all deaths in hypoxaemic pups occur during the first 2 days. Of 183 pups with hypoxia, 63 died, 92.7% of them within 48 h after birth. Among infectious causes, bacterial infection is the most common cause of neonatal mortality.

The pathophysiology remains unclear, although evidence exists that surgical trauma and the use of cardiopulmonary bypass provoke an immune response leading to PPS. We hypothesized that an intraoperative dose of dexamethasone decreases the risk of PPS, by reducing this inflammatory response.\r\nMETHODS:\r\nWe performed a subanalysis of the DECS study, which is a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial of 4,494 patients undergoing cardiac surgery with use of cardiopulmonary bypass.

In this substudy, we retrospectively analyzed the occurrence of PPS in 822 patients who were included in the DECS trial and underwent valvular surgery.

Fibulin-6, an ECM protein is expressed in cell junctions particularly in tissues subjected to significant mechanical stress. Fibulin-6 deficiency results in defective cell migration in nematodes and early embryonic lethality in mice. The role of fibulin-6 in healthy and failing myocardium has not been described. We have examined the expression and distribution pattern of fibulin-6 during myocardial remodeling (MR) and detailed its effect on the migratory function of cardiac fibroblasts (CF) in response to TGF-β1.\r\nMETHODS AND RESULTS:\r\nIn healthy murine myocardium fibulin-6 expression is largely confined to larger coronary arteries. It is induced during the early and the late phase of remodeling after infarction in murine hearts predominantly in the scar-muscle junction. Similar results are obtained in human ischemic cardiomyopathy. Fibulin-6 is mostly expressed in close vicinity to vimentin positive cells and is also abundantly expressed in vitro in cultured neonatal CF. TGF-β1 does not induce smooth muscle actin in fibroblasts deficient of fibulin-6, which also compromised their migration. Cells that had migrated expressed more fibulin-6 compared to stationary cells. Plated on fibulin-6 depleted matrix, stress fiber induction in fibroblast in response to TGF-β1 was impaired. In ex vivo explant cultures from postinfarct myocardium, the number of emigrating fibroblasts was also significantly reduced by fibulin-6 siRNA knock down (KD).\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\nFibulin-6, a fibroblast released ECM protein may play an important role during myocardial remodeling by imparting an effect on cardiac fibroblast migration in close and complementary interplay with TGF-β1 signalling.','2014','Jun','20','2014-06-24 21:05:02',NULL,1,1),(443,1,'nick@masomurray.com','24948576','1569-9285','Interactive cardiovascular and thoracic surgery','Computational fluid dynamics of the right ventricular outflow tract and of the pulmonary artery: a bench model of flow dynamics.','© The Author 2014.

The reoperation rate at 5 years can be as high as 25% and depends on age, type of conduit, conduit diameter and principal heart malformation. The aim of this study is to provide a bench model with computer fluid dynamics to analyse the haemodynamics of the RVOT, pulmonary artery, its bifurcation, and left and right pulmonary arteries that in the future may serve as a tool for analysis and prediction of outcome following RVOT reconstruction.\r\nMETHODS:\r\nPressure, flow and diameter at the RVOT, pulmonary artery, bifurcation of the pulmonary artery, and left and right pulmonary arteries were measured in five normal pigs with a mean weight of 24.6 ± 0.89 kg. Data obtained were used for a 3D computer fluid-dynamics simulation of flow conditions, focusing on the pressure, flow and shear stress profile of the pulmonary trunk to the level of the left and right pulmonary arteries.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nThree inlet steady flow profiles were obtained at 0.2, 0.29 and 0.36 m/s that correspond to the flow rates of 1.5, 2.0 and 2.5 l/min flow at the RVOT. The flow velocity profile was constant at the RVOT down to the bifurcation and decreased at the left and right pulmonary arteries. In all three inlet velocity profiles, low sheer stress and low-velocity areas were detected along the left wall of the pulmonary artery, at the pulmonary artery bifurcation and at the ostia of both pulmonary arteries.\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\nThis computed fluid real-time model provides us with a realistic picture of fluid dynamics in the pulmonary tract area. Deep shear stress areas correspond to a turbulent flow profile that is a predictive factor for the development of vessel wall arteriosclerosis. We believe that this bench model may be a useful tool for further evaluation of RVOT pathology following surgical reconstructions.','2014','Jun','19','2014-06-24 21:05:02',NULL,1,1),(444,1,'nick@masomurray.com','24937347','1526-7598','Anesthesia and analgesia','The Long-Term Impact of Early Cardiovascular Therapy Intensification for Postoperative Troponin Elevation after Major Vascular Surgery.','','\r\nBACKGROUND::\r\nAcute cardiac events are a frequent cause of morbidity after vascular surgery. The impact of early evidence-based treatment for patients with an acute cardiac event after vascular surgery on long-term postoperative outcomes has not been extensively studied. We hypothesized that providing appropriate evidence-based treatment to patients with elevated postoperative cardiac troponin levels may limit long-term mortality.\r\nMETHODS::\r\nWe conducted a study of 667 consecutive major vascular surgery patients with an elevated postoperative troponin I level. We then determined which of these patients received medical therapy as per the 2007 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association recommendations for the medical management of patients with chronic stable angina. All patients with troponin elevation were then matched with 2 control patients without postoperative troponin elevation. Matching was done using logistic regression and nearest-neighbor matching methods. The primary study end point was 12 months survival without a major cardiac event (i.e., death, myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, or pulmonary edema requiring hospitalization).\r\nRESULTS::\r\nTherapy was intensified in 43 of 66 patients (65%) who suffered a troponin I elevation after surgery. Patients with a troponin I elevation not receiving intensified cardiovascular treatment had a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.77 (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.13-2.42; P = 0.004) for the primary study outcome as compared with the control group. In contrast, patients with a troponin I elevation who received intensified cardiovascular treatment had an HR of 0.63 (95% CI, 0.10-1.19; P = 0.45) for the primary outcome as compared with the control group. Patients with a troponin I elevation not receiving treatment intensification likely were at higher risk for a major cardiac event (HR, 2.80; 95% CI, 1.05-24.2; P = 0.04) compared with patients who did receive treatment intensification.\r\nCONCLUSIONS::\r\nThe main finding of this study was that in patients with elevated troponin I levels after noncardiac surgery, long-term adverse cardiac outcomes may likely be improved by following evidence-based recommendations for the medical management of acute coronary syndromes.','2014','Jun','16','2014-06-24 21:05:02',NULL,1,1),(445,1,'nick@masomurray.com','24937201','2329-0358','Annals of transplantation : quarterly of the Polish Transplantation Society','Comparative analysis of the quality of life for patients prior to and after heart transplantation.','','Background The aim of this study was to assess the quality of life of patients before and after heart transplantation (HTX).

The type of procedure, perioperative antiplatelet therapy, and other patient-related factors influence the risk of postoperative haemorrhage. Our objective was to analyze the postoperative risk factors for hemorrhagic complications and to determine the impact of antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy strategies on postoperative bleeding risk in patients with coronary stents undergoing non-cardiac surgery.\r\nPATIENTS AND METHODS:\r\nProspective, multicentre observational cohort study of 1134 consecutive patients with coronary stents undergoing non-cardiac surgery between April 2007 and April 2009. The primary outcome measure was the occurrence of an hemorrhagic complication during the first 30days following the surgery or intervention.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nAmong the 1134 patients evaluated, 108 (9.5%) experienced a postoperative hemorrhagic complication (with a median time to occurrence of 5.3days). These complications were considered major, involved the operative site, and required reoperation in 92 (85.2%), 92 (85.2%), and 20 (18.5%) of patients, respectively. Mortality in patients with a haemorrhagic complication was 12% (n=13). Independent postoperative factors associated with haemorrhagic complications were identified as a high and intermediate bleeding risk procedure and the use and dose of anticoagulants. When interrupted before the procedure, resumption of antiplatelet treatment was delayed in patients developing early postoperative hemorrhagic complications.\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\nPatients with coronary stents who undergo surgery are at high risk for hemorrhagic complications.','2014','May','15','2014-06-24 21:05:02',NULL,1,1),(448,1,'nick@masomurray.com','24908593','1873-4529','Journal of clinical anesthesia','Anesthetic management and outcomes for patients with pulmonary hypertension and intracardiac shunts and Eisenmenger syndrome: a review of institutional experience.','Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Significant systemic arterial hypotension occurred in 14 individuals (26%) and oxygen desaturation in 9 (17%) patients. Administration of an intravenous (IV) vasopressor agent during induction significantly decreased the incidence of hypotension. The type of IV induction agent did not influence hemodynamic alterations, though patients who received propofol experienced a trend towards increased hypotension (83% of pts) when a vasopressor was not used. Inhalational induction, regardless of vasopressor use, was more likely to result in hypotension (60% of pts). The 30-day mortality was 3.8% (two pts). Both patients had minor elective procedures with monitored anesthesia care (MAC).\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\nHypotension is more common in patients with Eisenmenger syndrome and similar physiology when a vasopressor is not used during the peri-induction period, regardless of induction agent. Etomidate tended to have better hemodynamic stability than other induction agents. The use of a vasopressor is recommended. We present general recommendations for anesthesiologists and strongly recommend use of a vasopressor before or during induction to reduce hypotension along with complete avoidance of inhalational induction. Further, MAC anesthesia has been associated with perioperative and 30-day mortality.','2014','Jun','4','2014-06-24 21:05:02',NULL,1,1),(449,1,'nick@masomurray.com','24906370','2047-9980','Journal of the American Heart Association','Assessment of a university of california, los angeles 4-variable risk score for advanced heart failure.','© 2014 The Authors.

The outcome was survival free from urgent transplantation or LVAD. The model-predicted survival was compared to Kaplan-Meier\'s estimated survival at 1, 2, and 3 years. Model discrimination and calibration were assessed. During a mean follow-up of 2.1 years, 37 (21%) events occurred. One-, 2- and 3-year observed event-free survival was 88%, 81%, and 75%, and the observed/predicted ratio was 0.97, 0.96, and 0.97, respectively.

The difference between observed and predicted survival ranged from -14 to +17 percentage points, suggesting poor model calibration. Fairly similar results were found when the analyses were repeated in 715 patients after multivariate imputation of missing data.\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\nThe UCLA 4-variable risk model calibration was inconsistent and high-risk discrimination was poor in an external validation cohort.

While donor identity of DNA extracted directly from blood collected in standard tubes containing anticoagulants can be easily verified by generating STR profiles, RNA from blood collected in PAXgene Blood RNA tubes (PAXgene RNA tubes) is depleted of DNA and is not amenable to STR fingerprinting for donor identity verification.

Adaptation of quality assurance methods such as the PAXgene RNA tube DNA extraction/STR fingerprinting assay described here is a good practice that ensures that biobanking collections provide scientists with high quality, donor-verified biomaterial.','2014','Jun','','2014-06-24 21:05:06',NULL,1,1),(464,2,'nickm@masomurray.com','24955573','1932-6203','PloS one','Edoxaban in the Evolving Scenario of Non Vitamin K Antagonist Oral Anticoagulants Imputed Placebo Analysis and Multiple Treatment Comparisons.','','\r\nBACKGROUND:\r\nEdoxaban recently proved non-inferior to warfarin for prevention of thromboembolism in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF).

If patient is suffering from diabetes, the incidence of cognitive dysfunction greatly increased. We therefore aimed to investigate the effects of isoflurane anesthesia on cognitive dysfunction in a diabetic rat model induced by a single injection of streptozotocin (STZ).

Simple rotation of the catheter, echocardiography-guided placement to the centre of the ventricle, or ventricular expansion through crystalloid infusion may correct for these artifacts. Fluid administration, however, alters left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and volume and therefore stroke volume, thereby obscuring continuous real-time haemodynamic measurements.\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\nPressure-volume artifacts during inotropic infusion are caused by physical contact of the catheter with endocardium.

Epidemiological studies have shown that respiratory tract infections are associated with an increased risk of thrombotic-related vascular disease such as myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke and venous thrombosis. Myocardial infarction and stroke have been detected essentially in the early phase of the disease, i.e. within 48 hours from hospital admission, with an incidence ranging from as low as 1% to as high as 11%. Age, previous cardiovascular events and high pneumonia severity index were independent predictors of myocardial infarction; clinical predictors of stroke were not identified. Deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism may also occur after pneumonia but incidence and clinical predictors must be defined. Biological plausibility of such association may be deduced by experimental and clinical studies, showing that lung infection is complicated by platelet aggregation and clotting system activation, as documented by up-regulation of Tissue Factor and down-regulation of activated Protein C. The effect of antithrombotic drugs have been examined in experimental and clinical studies but results are still inconclusive. Thrombotic-related vascular disease such as myocardial infarction, stroke and venous thrombosis may complicate the clinical course of pneumonia and worsen its prognosis. Further definition of predictors may help to identify patients at higher risk of artery and venous thrombosis.

However, treatment programs for chronic pain typically take a rehabilitative approach, emphasizing decreasing pain-related disability first with the expectation that pain reduction will follow. This information is routinely provided to patients yet no studies have systematically examined the actual trajectories of pain and disability in a clinical care setting. In this study of youth with chronic pain (N=94, 8-18 years), it was hypothesized that 1) functional disability and pain would decrease over the course of psychological treatment for chronic pain and 2) functional disability would decrease more quickly than pain intensity. Participants received cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for pain management (M = 5.6 sessions) plus standard medical care. The Functional Disability Inventory and a Numeric Rating Scale of average pain intensity were completed by the child at every CBT session. Hierarchical linear modeling was conducted to examine the longitudinal trajectories of disability and pain. Standardized estimates of the slopes of change were obtained to test differences in rates of change between pain and disability. Results showed an overall significant decline in functional disability over time. While pain scores reduced slightly from pre- to post-treatment, the longitudinal decline over treatment was not statistically significant. As expected, the rate of change of disability was significantly more rapid than pain.

Mast cell carboxypeptidase A (MC-CPA) is released solely from MCs and plays a critical role in degrading toxins and endothelin 1 (ET-1). The present study sought to explore whether MC-CPA is involved in the process of IPC in a rodent model of small intestinal ischemia reperfusion (IIR) injury.\r\nMATERIALS AND METHODS:\r\nIIR injuries were induced in Sprague-Dawley rats by clamping the superior mesenteric artery for 60 min followed by reperfusion for 2 h. One cycle of 10 min intestinal ischemia and 10 min of reperfusion was used in the IPC group, and the MC stabilizer cromolyn sodium and MC potato carboxypeptidase inhibitor were administered before the start of IPC. At the end of experiment, intestine tissue was obtained for assays of the MC-CPA3, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, and ET-1 contents and myeloperoxidase activities. Intestinal histologic injury scores and MC degranulation were assessed. Apoptosis indices and cleaved caspase- 3 protein expressions were quantified.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nIIR resulted in severe injury, as evidenced by significant increases in injury scores and MC-CPA3, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, and ET-1 contents that were accompanied with concomitant elevations in cleaved caspase 3 expression, apoptosis indices, and myeloperoxidase activities. IPC induced a significant increase in MC-CPA3, induced MC degranulation, and attenuated IIR injury by downregulating IIR-induced biochemical changes, whereas cromolyn sodium and potato carboxypeptidase inhibitor abolished the IPC-mediated changes.\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\nThese data suggest that IPC protected against IIR injury via the MC degranulation-mediated release of MC-CPA.','2014','May','23','2014-06-24 21:05:06',NULL,1,1),(480,2,'nickm@masomurray.com','24953890','1523-6838','American journal of kidney diseases : the official journal of the National Kidney Foundation','Serum Bicarbonate Concentrations and Kidney Disease Progression in Community-Living Elders: The Health, Aging, and Body Composition (Health ABC) Study.','Published by Elsevier Inc.','\r\nBACKGROUND:\r\nIn populations with prevalent chronic kidney disease (CKD), lower serum bicarbonate levels are associated with more rapid CKD progression, but whether lower bicarbonate levels also are associated with risk of incident estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)\r\nSTUDY DESIGN:\r\nLongitudinal observational cohort study.\r\nSETTING & PARTICIPANTS:\r\nWell-functioning community-living elders aged 70-79 years at inception.\r\nPREDICTOR:\r\nSerum bicarbonate level measured at the time of collection by arterialized venous blood sample using an arterial blood gas analyzer.\r\nOUTCOMES:\r\nChange in eGFR over 7 years, and new eGFR\r\nMEASUREMENTS:\r\nLinear and logistic regressions were used to evaluate associations of baseline serum bicarbonate level with change in eGFR and incident eGFR\r\nRESULTS:\r\nAt baseline, mean eGFR was 84±16 (SD)mL/min/1.73m(2), and serum bicarbonate level was 25.2±1.9mmol/L.

The in vivo role of FoxO1 in the regulation of cardiac NaV1.5 expression remains unknown. The present study aimed to define the role of FoxO1 in the regulation of NaV1.5 expression and cardiac Na(+) channel activity in mouse ventricular cardiomyocytes and assess the cardiac electrophysiological phenotype of mice with cardiac FoxO1 deletion. Tamoxifen-induced and cardiac-specific FoxO1 deletion was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Cardiac FoxO1 deletion failed to result in either cardiac functional changes or hypertrophy as assessed by echocardiography and individual ventricular cell capacitances, respectively. Western blotting showed that FoxO1 was significantly decreased while NaV1.5 protein level was significantly increased in mouse hearts with FoxO1 deletion. Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) revealed that FoxO1 deletion led to an increase in NaV1.5 and Na(+) channel subunit β3 mRNA, but not β1, 2, 4, or connexin 43. Whole patch-clamp recordings demonstrated that cardiac Na(+) currents were significantly augmented by FoxO1 deletion without affecting the steady-state activation and inactivation, leading to accelerated depolarization of action potentials in mouse ventricular cardiomyocytes. Electrocardiogram recordings showed that the QRS complex was significantly shortened and P wave amplitude was significantly increased in conscious and unrestrained mice with cardiac FoxO1 deletion. NaV1.5 expression was decreased in the peri-infarct (border-zone) of mice with myocardial infarction and FoxO1 accumulated in the cardiomyocyte nuclei of chronic ischemic human hearts. Our findings indicate that FoxO1 plays an important role in the regulation of NaV1.5 and β3 subunit expression as well as Na(+) channel activity in the heart and that FoxO1 is involved in the modulation of NaV1.5 expression in ischemic heart disease.','2014','Jun','20','2014-06-24 21:05:10',NULL,1,1),(482,3,'blindmurray@gmail.com','24955355','2314-6141','BioMed research international','Recombinant Human Factor IX Produced from Transgenic Porcine Milk.','','Production of biopharmaceuticals from transgenic animal milk is a cost-effective method for highly complex proteins that cannot be efficiently produced using conventional systems such as microorganisms or animal cells.

The purpose of this work was to test the possibility that the facilitation of lordosis behavior in estrogen-primed rats by progesterone (P) and its 5α- and 5β-reduced metabolites, gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH), leptin, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and vagino-cervical stimulation (VCS) involves interactions with classical ERs by using the selective ER modulator, tamoxifen. To further assess the role of ERs, we also explored the effects of the pure ER antagonist, ICI182780 (ICI), on estrous behavior induced by P and GnRH. Ovariectomized, estrogen-primed rats (5 μg estradiol benzoate 40 hr earlier) were injected intraventricularly with the above-mentioned compounds, or they received VCS. All compounds and VCS effectively facilitated estrous behavior when tested at 60, 120 or 240 min after infusion or application of VCS. Intraventricular infusion of tamoxifen (5 μg), 30 min prior, significantly attenuated estrous behaviors induced in estradiol-primed rats by P, most of its 5α- and 5β-reduced metabolites, GnRH, and PGE2, but not by VCS. Although there was a trend for reduction, tamoxifen did not significantly decrease lordosis in females treated with 5β-pregnan-3,20-dione. ICI also inhibited lordosis behavior induced by P and GnRH at some testing intervals. These results suggest that activation of classical ERs participates in the triggering effects on estrous behavior induced by agents with different chemical structures that do not bind directly to ERs.','2014','Jun','19','2014-06-24 21:05:10',NULL,1,1),(486,3,'blindmurray@gmail.com','24954165','1872-6623','Pain','Differential changes in functional disability and pain intensity over the course of psychological treatment for children with chronic pain.','Copyright © 2014.

However, treatment programs for chronic pain typically take a rehabilitative approach, emphasizing decreasing pain-related disability first with the expectation that pain reduction will follow. This information is routinely provided to patients yet no studies have systematically examined the actual trajectories of pain and disability in a clinical care setting. In this study of youth with chronic pain (N=94, 8-18 years), it was hypothesized that 1) functional disability and pain would decrease over the course of psychological treatment for chronic pain and 2) functional disability would decrease more quickly than pain intensity. Participants received cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for pain management (M = 5.6 sessions) plus standard medical care. The Functional Disability Inventory and a Numeric Rating Scale of average pain intensity were completed by the child at every CBT session. Hierarchical linear modeling was conducted to examine the longitudinal trajectories of disability and pain. Standardized estimates of the slopes of change were obtained to test differences in rates of change between pain and disability. Results showed an overall significant decline in functional disability over time. While pain scores reduced slightly from pre- to post-treatment, the longitudinal decline over treatment was not statistically significant. As expected, the rate of change of disability was significantly more rapid than pain. Evidence for variability in treatment response was noted suggesting the need for additional research into individual trajectories of change in pediatric pain treatment.','2014','Jun','19','2014-06-24 21:05:10',NULL,1,1),(487,3,'blindmurray@gmail.com','24953887','1528-8447','The journal of pain : official journal of the American Pain Society','The economic costs of chronic pain among a cohort of treatment seeking adolescents in the United States.','Copyright © 2014 American Pain Society.

However, the minimal blood volume for effective processing under clinically relevant conditions has yet to be determined.\r\nSTUDY DESIGN AND METHODS:\r\nFresh blood from volunteer donations adjusted to a hematocrit (Hct) of 10% was used to test ELECTA (Sorin) equipped with a 55-mL bowl, C.A.T.S (Fresenius) in the pediatric program mode, and OrthoPAT (Haemonetics). Twenty-milliliter portions of red blood cells (RBCs) were added and processed under various conditions, including clinically relevant first filling and intermittent emptying. RBC recovery and availability and plasma elimination were calculated from the Hct, free hemoglobin, and total protein.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nThe main impediment to recovery and availability was the first filling. There, RBC recovery was significantly reduced, while it subsequently varied between 93 and 98%. To produce the first 30 mL of RBCs, ELECTA required 42 mL and C.A.T.S and OrthoPAT 62 mL owing to the dead space of the separation chamber or reservoir, respectively. RBC availability was much higher in subsequent processes, with only minimal differences between the three devices. They all consistently provided high plasma elimination rates.\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\nThe continuous system showed no advantage over a small Latham bowl. From the results it can be calculated that the limit for feasible cell salvage at present is an infant of 6 months.

These studies have raised significant safety concerns regarding the use of anesthetics in the pediatric population and highlight the need for a better model to study anesthetic-induced neurotoxicity in humans. Human embryonic stem cells are capable of differentiating into any cell type and represent a promising model to study mechanisms governing anesthetic-induced neurotoxicity.\r\nMETHODS::\r\nCell death in human embryonic stem cell-derived neurons was assessed using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate in situ nick end labeling staining, and microRNA expression was assessed using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. miR-21 was overexpressed and knocked down using an miR-21 mimic and antagomir, respectively.

We investigated the molecular changes associated with acquired hormono-resistances in patient-derived xenografts of LBC. Experimental design: Two LBC xenografts (HBCx22 and HBCx34) were treated with different endocrine therapies (ET) to obtain xenografts with acquired resistances to tamoxifen (TamR) and ovariectomy (OvaR). PI3K pathway activation was analyzed by western blot and immunohistochemistry and responses to ET combined to everolimus were investigated in vivo. Gene expression analyses were performed by RT-PCR and Affymetrix arrays. Results: HBCx22 TamR xenograft was cross-resistant to several hormono-therapies, while HBCx22 OvaR and HBCx34 TamR exhibited a treatment specific resistance profile. PI3K pathway was similarly activated in parental and resistant xenografts but the addition of everolimus didn\'t restore the response to tamoxifen in TamR xenografts. By contrast, the combination of fulvestrant and everolimus induced tumor regression in vivo in HBCx34 TamR, where we found a cross-talk between ER and PI3K pathways. Expression of several ER-controlled genes and ER co-regulators was significantly changed in both TamR and OvaR tumors, indicating impaired ER transcriptional activity. Expression changes associated with hormono-resistance were both tumor and treatment specific and were enriched for genes involved in cell growth, cell death and cell survival. Conclusions: PDX models of LBC with acquired resistance to endocrine therapies show a great diversity of resistance phenotype, associated to specific deregulations of ER-mediated gene transcription.

Altogether, morbidity and mortality ranges, according to the literature, from 5 to 35%. Among non-infectious causes besides hypoxia during birth, hypothermia, hypoglycaemia and dehydration are mostly responsible for puppy diseases and losses. Approximately 90% of all deaths in hypoxaemic pups occur during the first 2 days. Of 183 pups with hypoxia, 63 died, 92.7% of them within 48 h after birth. Among infectious causes, bacterial infection is the most common cause of neonatal mortality. Escherichia coli, streptococci, staphylococci, Pseudomonas sp., Klebsiella sp., Enterobacter sp. and some other micro-organisms are regularly involved in neonatal infections. Post-mortem findings especially document E. coli, Staphylococcus sp. and Streptococcus sp. as responsible bacteria.

The pathophysiology remains unclear, although evidence exists that surgical trauma and the use of cardiopulmonary bypass provoke an immune response leading to PPS. We hypothesized that an intraoperative dose of dexamethasone decreases the risk of PPS, by reducing this inflammatory response.\r\nMETHODS:\r\nWe performed a subanalysis of the DECS study, which is a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial of 4,494 patients undergoing cardiac surgery with use of cardiopulmonary bypass. The aim of the DECS study was to investigate whether a single intraoperative dose of 1 mg/kg dexamethasone reduced the incidence of a composite of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, renal failure, or respiratory failure, within 30 days of randomization. In this substudy, we retrospectively analyzed the occurrence of PPS in 822 patients who were included in the DECS trial and underwent valvular surgery. Postpericardiotomy syndrome was diagnosed if 2 of 5 listed symptoms were present: unexplained fever, pleuritic chest pain, pericardial or pleural rub, new or worsening pericardial or pleural effusion. All medical charts, x-rays, and echocardiograms were reviewed. Secondary end point was the occurrence of complicated PPS, defined as PPS with need for evacuation of pleural effusion, pericardiocentesis, and tamponade requiring intervention or hospital readmission for PPS.

Fibulin-6, an ECM protein is expressed in cell junctions particularly in tissues subjected to significant mechanical stress. Fibulin-6 deficiency results in defective cell migration in nematodes and early embryonic lethality in mice. The role of fibulin-6 in healthy and failing myocardium has not been described. We have examined the expression and distribution pattern of fibulin-6 during myocardial remodeling (MR) and detailed its effect on the migratory function of cardiac fibroblasts (CF) in response to TGF-β1.\r\nMETHODS AND RESULTS:\r\nIn healthy murine myocardium fibulin-6 expression is largely confined to larger coronary arteries. It is induced during the early and the late phase of remodeling after infarction in murine hearts predominantly in the scar-muscle junction. Similar results are obtained in human ischemic cardiomyopathy. Fibulin-6 is mostly expressed in close vicinity to vimentin positive cells and is also abundantly expressed in vitro in cultured neonatal CF. TGF-β1 does not induce smooth muscle actin in fibroblasts deficient of fibulin-6, which also compromised their migration. Cells that had migrated expressed more fibulin-6 compared to stationary cells. Plated on fibulin-6 depleted matrix, stress fiber induction in fibroblast in response to TGF-β1 was impaired. In ex vivo explant cultures from postinfarct myocardium, the number of emigrating fibroblasts was also significantly reduced by fibulin-6 siRNA knock down (KD).\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\nFibulin-6, a fibroblast released ECM protein may play an important role during myocardial remodeling by imparting an effect on cardiac fibroblast migration in close and complementary interplay with TGF-β1 signalling.','2014','Jun','20','2014-06-24 21:06:42',NULL,1,1),(503,1,'nick@masomurray.com','24948576','1569-9285','Interactive cardiovascular and thoracic surgery','Computational fluid dynamics of the right ventricular outflow tract and of the pulmonary artery: a bench model of flow dynamics.','© The Author 2014.

The reoperation rate at 5 years can be as high as 25% and depends on age, type of conduit, conduit diameter and principal heart malformation. The aim of this study is to provide a bench model with computer fluid dynamics to analyse the haemodynamics of the RVOT, pulmonary artery, its bifurcation, and left and right pulmonary arteries that in the future may serve as a tool for analysis and prediction of outcome following RVOT reconstruction.\r\nMETHODS:\r\nPressure, flow and diameter at the RVOT, pulmonary artery, bifurcation of the pulmonary artery, and left and right pulmonary arteries were measured in five normal pigs with a mean weight of 24.6 ± 0.89 kg. Data obtained were used for a 3D computer fluid-dynamics simulation of flow conditions, focusing on the pressure, flow and shear stress profile of the pulmonary trunk to the level of the left and right pulmonary arteries.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nThree inlet steady flow profiles were obtained at 0.2, 0.29 and 0.36 m/s that correspond to the flow rates of 1.5, 2.0 and 2.5 l/min flow at the RVOT. The flow velocity profile was constant at the RVOT down to the bifurcation and decreased at the left and right pulmonary arteries. In all three inlet velocity profiles, low sheer stress and low-velocity areas were detected along the left wall of the pulmonary artery, at the pulmonary artery bifurcation and at the ostia of both pulmonary arteries.\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\nThis computed fluid real-time model provides us with a realistic picture of fluid dynamics in the pulmonary tract area. Deep shear stress areas correspond to a turbulent flow profile that is a predictive factor for the development of vessel wall arteriosclerosis. We believe that this bench model may be a useful tool for further evaluation of RVOT pathology following surgical reconstructions.','2014','Jun','19','2014-06-24 21:06:42',NULL,1,1),(504,1,'nick@masomurray.com','24937347','1526-7598','Anesthesia and analgesia','The Long-Term Impact of Early Cardiovascular Therapy Intensification for Postoperative Troponin Elevation after Major Vascular Surgery.','','\r\nBACKGROUND::\r\nAcute cardiac events are a frequent cause of morbidity after vascular surgery. The impact of early evidence-based treatment for patients with an acute cardiac event after vascular surgery on long-term postoperative outcomes has not been extensively studied. We hypothesized that providing appropriate evidence-based treatment to patients with elevated postoperative cardiac troponin levels may limit long-term mortality.\r\nMETHODS::\r\nWe conducted a study of 667 consecutive major vascular surgery patients with an elevated postoperative troponin I level. We then determined which of these patients received medical therapy as per the 2007 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association recommendations for the medical management of patients with chronic stable angina. All patients with troponin elevation were then matched with 2 control patients without postoperative troponin elevation. Matching was done using logistic regression and nearest-neighbor matching methods. The primary study end point was 12 months survival without a major cardiac event (i.e., death, myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, or pulmonary edema requiring hospitalization).\r\nRESULTS::\r\nTherapy was intensified in 43 of 66 patients (65%) who suffered a troponin I elevation after surgery. Patients with a troponin I elevation not receiving intensified cardiovascular treatment had a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.77 (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.13-2.42; P = 0.004) for the primary study outcome as compared with the control group. In contrast, patients with a troponin I elevation who received intensified cardiovascular treatment had an HR of 0.63 (95% CI, 0.10-1.19; P = 0.45) for the primary outcome as compared with the control group. Patients with a troponin I elevation not receiving treatment intensification likely were at higher risk for a major cardiac event (HR, 2.80; 95% CI, 1.05-24.2; P = 0.04) compared with patients who did receive treatment intensification.\r\nCONCLUSIONS::\r\nThe main finding of this study was that in patients with elevated troponin I levels after noncardiac surgery, long-term adverse cardiac outcomes may likely be improved by following evidence-based recommendations for the medical management of acute coronary syndromes.','2014','Jun','16','2014-06-24 21:06:42',NULL,1,1),(505,1,'nick@masomurray.com','24937201','2329-0358','Annals of transplantation : quarterly of the Polish Transplantation Society','Comparative analysis of the quality of life for patients prior to and after heart transplantation.','','Background The aim of this study was to assess the quality of life of patients before and after heart transplantation (HTX).

The type of procedure, perioperative antiplatelet therapy, and other patient-related factors influence the risk of postoperative haemorrhage. Our objective was to analyze the postoperative risk factors for hemorrhagic complications and to determine the impact of antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy strategies on postoperative bleeding risk in patients with coronary stents undergoing non-cardiac surgery.\r\nPATIENTS AND METHODS:\r\nProspective, multicentre observational cohort study of 1134 consecutive patients with coronary stents undergoing non-cardiac surgery between April 2007 and April 2009. The primary outcome measure was the occurrence of an hemorrhagic complication during the first 30days following the surgery or intervention.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nAmong the 1134 patients evaluated, 108 (9.5%) experienced a postoperative hemorrhagic complication (with a median time to occurrence of 5.3days). These complications were considered major, involved the operative site, and required reoperation in 92 (85.2%), 92 (85.2%), and 20 (18.5%) of patients, respectively. Mortality in patients with a haemorrhagic complication was 12% (n=13). Independent postoperative factors associated with haemorrhagic complications were identified as a high and intermediate bleeding risk procedure and the use and dose of anticoagulants.

Significant systemic arterial hypotension occurred in 14 individuals (26%) and oxygen desaturation in 9 (17%) patients. Administration of an intravenous (IV) vasopressor agent during induction significantly decreased the incidence of hypotension. The type of IV induction agent did not influence hemodynamic alterations, though patients who received propofol experienced a trend towards increased hypotension (83% of pts) when a vasopressor was not used. Inhalational induction, regardless of vasopressor use, was more likely to result in hypotension (60% of pts). The 30-day mortality was 3.8% (two pts). Both patients had minor elective procedures with monitored anesthesia care (MAC).\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\nHypotension is more common in patients with Eisenmenger syndrome and similar physiology when a vasopressor is not used during the peri-induction period, regardless of induction agent. Etomidate tended to have better hemodynamic stability than other induction agents. The use of a vasopressor is recommended. We present general recommendations for anesthesiologists and strongly recommend use of a vasopressor before or during induction to reduce hypotension along with complete avoidance of inhalational induction. Further, MAC anesthesia has been associated with perioperative and 30-day mortality.','2014','Jun','4','2014-06-24 21:06:42',NULL,1,1),(509,1,'nick@masomurray.com','24906370','2047-9980','Journal of the American Heart Association','Assessment of a university of california, los angeles 4-variable risk score for advanced heart failure.','© 2014 The Authors.

While donor identity of DNA extracted directly from blood collected in standard tubes containing anticoagulants can be easily verified by generating STR profiles, RNA from blood collected in PAXgene Blood RNA tubes (PAXgene RNA tubes) is depleted of DNA and is not amenable to STR fingerprinting for donor identity verification. We investigated the feasibility of isolating DNA directly from blood collected in PAXgene RNA tubes for use as template for STR DNA fingerprinting for blood donor identity verification. We determined that DNA extraction can be performed manually with the QIAamp DNA Blood Minikit or on the QIAxtractor instrument with minimal pre-processing protocol additions, and that DNA isolated from blood collected in PAXgene RNA tubes is of sufficient quantity and quality for successful STR fingerprint analysis.

We therefore aimed to investigate the effects of isoflurane anesthesia on cognitive dysfunction in a diabetic rat model induced by a single injection of streptozotocin (STZ).

Simple rotation of the catheter, echocardiography-guided placement to the centre of the ventricle, or ventricular expansion through crystalloid infusion may correct for these artifacts. Fluid administration, however, alters left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and volume and therefore stroke volume, thereby obscuring continuous real-time haemodynamic measurements.\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\nPressure-volume artifacts during inotropic infusion are caused by physical contact of the catheter with endocardium.

Myocardial infarction and stroke have been detected essentially in the early phase of the disease, i.e. within 48 hours from hospital admission, with an incidence ranging from as low as 1% to as high as 11%. Age, previous cardiovascular events and high pneumonia severity index were independent predictors of myocardial infarction; clinical predictors of stroke were not identified. Deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism may also occur after pneumonia but incidence and clinical predictors must be defined. Biological plausibility of such association may be deduced by experimental and clinical studies, showing that lung infection is complicated by platelet aggregation and clotting system activation, as documented by up-regulation of Tissue Factor and down-regulation of activated Protein C. The effect of antithrombotic drugs have been examined in experimental and clinical studies but results are still inconclusive.

However, treatment programs for chronic pain typically take a rehabilitative approach, emphasizing decreasing pain-related disability first with the expectation that pain reduction will follow. This information is routinely provided to patients yet no studies have systematically examined the actual trajectories of pain and disability in a clinical care setting. In this study of youth with chronic pain (N=94, 8-18 years), it was hypothesized that 1) functional disability and pain would decrease over the course of psychological treatment for chronic pain and 2) functional disability would decrease more quickly than pain intensity. Participants received cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for pain management (M = 5.6 sessions) plus standard medical care. The Functional Disability Inventory and a Numeric Rating Scale of average pain intensity were completed by the child at every CBT session. Hierarchical linear modeling was conducted to examine the longitudinal trajectories of disability and pain. Standardized estimates of the slopes of change were obtained to test differences in rates of change between pain and disability. Results showed an overall significant decline in functional disability over time. While pain scores reduced slightly from pre- to post-treatment, the longitudinal decline over treatment was not statistically significant. As expected, the rate of change of disability was significantly more rapid than pain.

Mast cell carboxypeptidase A (MC-CPA) is released solely from MCs and plays a critical role in degrading toxins and endothelin 1 (ET-1). The present study sought to explore whether MC-CPA is involved in the process of IPC in a rodent model of small intestinal ischemia reperfusion (IIR) injury.\r\nMATERIALS AND METHODS:\r\nIIR injuries were induced in Sprague-Dawley rats by clamping the superior mesenteric artery for 60 min followed by reperfusion for 2 h. One cycle of 10 min intestinal ischemia and 10 min of reperfusion was used in the IPC group, and the MC stabilizer cromolyn sodium and MC potato carboxypeptidase inhibitor were administered before the start of IPC. At the end of experiment, intestine tissue was obtained for assays of the MC-CPA3, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, and ET-1 contents and myeloperoxidase activities. Intestinal histologic injury scores and MC degranulation were assessed. Apoptosis indices and cleaved caspase- 3 protein expressions were quantified.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nIIR resulted in severe injury, as evidenced by significant increases in injury scores and MC-CPA3, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, and ET-1 contents that were accompanied with concomitant elevations in cleaved caspase 3 expression, apoptosis indices, and myeloperoxidase activities. IPC induced a significant increase in MC-CPA3, induced MC degranulation, and attenuated IIR injury by downregulating IIR-induced biochemical changes, whereas cromolyn sodium and potato carboxypeptidase inhibitor abolished the IPC-mediated changes.\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\nThese data suggest that IPC protected against IIR injury via the MC degranulation-mediated release of MC-CPA.','2014','May','23','2014-06-24 21:06:46',NULL,1,1),(540,2,'nickm@masomurray.com','24953890','1523-6838','American journal of kidney diseases : the official journal of the National Kidney Foundation','Serum Bicarbonate Concentrations and Kidney Disease Progression in Community-Living Elders: The Health, Aging, and Body Composition (Health ABC) Study.','Published by Elsevier Inc.','\r\nBACKGROUND:\r\nIn populations with prevalent chronic kidney disease (CKD), lower serum bicarbonate levels are associated with more rapid CKD progression, but whether lower bicarbonate levels also are associated with risk of incident estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)\r\nSTUDY DESIGN:\r\nLongitudinal observational cohort study.\r\nSETTING & PARTICIPANTS:\r\nWell-functioning community-living elders aged 70-79 years at inception.\r\nPREDICTOR:\r\nSerum bicarbonate level measured at the time of collection by arterialized venous blood sample using an arterial blood gas analyzer.\r\nOUTCOMES:\r\nChange in eGFR over 7 years, and new eGFR\r\nMEASUREMENTS:\r\nLinear and logistic regressions were used to evaluate associations of baseline serum bicarbonate level with change in eGFR and incident eGFR\r\nRESULTS:\r\nAt baseline, mean eGFR was 84±16 (SD)mL/min/1.73m(2), and serum bicarbonate level was 25.2±1.9mmol/L.

The present study aimed to define the role of FoxO1 in the regulation of NaV1.5 expression and cardiac Na(+) channel activity in mouse ventricular cardiomyocytes and assess the cardiac electrophysiological phenotype of mice with cardiac FoxO1 deletion. Tamoxifen-induced and cardiac-specific FoxO1 deletion was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Cardiac FoxO1 deletion failed to result in either cardiac functional changes or hypertrophy as assessed by echocardiography and individual ventricular cell capacitances, respectively. Western blotting showed that FoxO1 was significantly decreased while NaV1.5 protein level was significantly increased in mouse hearts with FoxO1 deletion. Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) revealed that FoxO1 deletion led to an increase in NaV1.5 and Na(+) channel subunit β3 mRNA, but not β1, 2, 4, or connexin 43. Whole patch-clamp recordings demonstrated that cardiac Na(+) currents were significantly augmented by FoxO1 deletion without affecting the steady-state activation and inactivation, leading to accelerated depolarization of action potentials in mouse ventricular cardiomyocytes. Electrocardiogram recordings showed that the QRS complex was significantly shortened and P wave amplitude was significantly increased in conscious and unrestrained mice with cardiac FoxO1 deletion. NaV1.5 expression was decreased in the peri-infarct (border-zone) of mice with myocardial infarction and FoxO1 accumulated in the cardiomyocyte nuclei of chronic ischemic human hearts.

The purified protein had high specific activity and a low ratio of the active form (FIXa). The purified rhFIX had 11.9 γ-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) residues/mol protein, which approached full occupancy of the 12 potential sites in the Gla domain. The rhFIX was shown to have a higher isoelectric point and lower sialic acid content than plasma-derived FIX (pdFIX). The rhFIX had the same N-glycosylation sites and phosphorylation sites as pdFIX, but had a higher specific activity. These results suggest that rhFIX produced from porcine milk is physiologically active and they support the use of transgenic animals as bioreactors for industrial scale production in milk.','2014','','','2014-06-24 21:06:50',NULL,1,1),(543,3,'blindmurray@gmail.com','24955272','2090-6803','Case reports in pediatrics','Septic bursitis in an 8-year-old boy.','','Background.

The purpose of this work was to test the possibility that the facilitation of lordosis behavior in estrogen-primed rats by progesterone (P) and its 5α- and 5β-reduced metabolites, gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH), leptin, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and vagino-cervical stimulation (VCS) involves interactions with classical ERs by using the selective ER modulator, tamoxifen. To further assess the role of ERs, we also explored the effects of the pure ER antagonist, ICI182780 (ICI), on estrous behavior induced by P and GnRH. Ovariectomized, estrogen-primed rats (5 μg estradiol benzoate 40 hr earlier) were injected intraventricularly with the above-mentioned compounds, or they received VCS. All compounds and VCS effectively facilitated estrous behavior when tested at 60, 120 or 240 min after infusion or application of VCS. Intraventricular infusion of tamoxifen (5 μg), 30 min prior, significantly attenuated estrous behaviors induced in estradiol-primed rats by P, most of its 5α- and 5β-reduced metabolites, GnRH, and PGE2, but not by VCS. Although there was a trend for reduction, tamoxifen did not significantly decrease lordosis in females treated with 5β-pregnan-3,20-dione. ICI also inhibited lordosis behavior induced by P and GnRH at some testing intervals. These results suggest that activation of classical ERs participates in the triggering effects on estrous behavior induced by agents with different chemical structures that do not bind directly to ERs.','2014','Jun','19','2014-06-24 21:06:50',NULL,1,1),(546,3,'blindmurray@gmail.com','24954165','1872-6623','Pain','Differential changes in functional disability and pain intensity over the course of psychological treatment for children with chronic pain.','Copyright © 2014.

However, treatment programs for chronic pain typically take a rehabilitative approach, emphasizing decreasing pain-related disability first with the expectation that pain reduction will follow. This information is routinely provided to patients yet no studies have systematically examined the actual trajectories of pain and disability in a clinical care setting. In this study of youth with chronic pain (N=94, 8-18 years), it was hypothesized that 1) functional disability and pain would decrease over the course of psychological treatment for chronic pain and 2) functional disability would decrease more quickly than pain intensity. Participants received cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for pain management (M = 5.6 sessions) plus standard medical care. The Functional Disability Inventory and a Numeric Rating Scale of average pain intensity were completed by the child at every CBT session. Hierarchical linear modeling was conducted to examine the longitudinal trajectories of disability and pain. Standardized estimates of the slopes of change were obtained to test differences in rates of change between pain and disability. Results showed an overall significant decline in functional disability over time. While pain scores reduced slightly from pre- to post-treatment, the longitudinal decline over treatment was not statistically significant. As expected, the rate of change of disability was significantly more rapid than pain. Evidence for variability in treatment response was noted suggesting the need for additional research into individual trajectories of change in pediatric pain treatment.','2014','Jun','19','2014-06-24 21:06:50',NULL,1,1),(547,3,'blindmurray@gmail.com','24953887','1528-8447','The journal of pain : official journal of the American Pain Society','The economic costs of chronic pain among a cohort of treatment seeking adolescents in the United States.','Copyright © 2014 American Pain Society.

However, the minimal blood volume for effective processing under clinically relevant conditions has yet to be determined.\r\nSTUDY DESIGN AND METHODS:\r\nFresh blood from volunteer donations adjusted to a hematocrit (Hct) of 10% was used to test ELECTA (Sorin) equipped with a 55-mL bowl, C.A.T.S (Fresenius) in the pediatric program mode, and OrthoPAT (Haemonetics). Twenty-milliliter portions of red blood cells (RBCs) were added and processed under various conditions, including clinically relevant first filling and intermittent emptying. RBC recovery and availability and plasma elimination were calculated from the Hct, free hemoglobin, and total protein.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nThe main impediment to recovery and availability was the first filling. There, RBC recovery was significantly reduced, while it subsequently varied between 93 and 98%. To produce the first 30 mL of RBCs, ELECTA required 42 mL and C.A.T.S and OrthoPAT 62 mL owing to the dead space of the separation chamber or reservoir, respectively. RBC availability was much higher in subsequent processes, with only minimal differences between the three devices. They all consistently provided high plasma elimination rates.\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\nThe continuous system showed no advantage over a small Latham bowl. From the results it can be calculated that the limit for feasible cell salvage at present is an infant of 6 months.

These studies have raised significant safety concerns regarding the use of anesthetics in the pediatric population and highlight the need for a better model to study anesthetic-induced neurotoxicity in humans. Human embryonic stem cells are capable of differentiating into any cell type and represent a promising model to study mechanisms governing anesthetic-induced neurotoxicity.\r\nMETHODS::\r\nCell death in human embryonic stem cell-derived neurons was assessed using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate in situ nick end labeling staining, and microRNA expression was assessed using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. miR-21 was overexpressed and knocked down using an miR-21 mimic and antagomir, respectively.

Methods : The records of patients operated on for a perforated duodenal ulcer in the last 8 years in two pediatric surgery centers were evaluated retrospectively. Patient demographics, symptoms, time to admission to hospital, operative findings, and postoperative clinical course were evaluated. Results : Nine children (mean age 13.2 years, range 6-170 years) were included. All patients were admitted in the first six hours after their abdominal pain started.

We investigated the molecular changes associated with acquired hormono-resistances in patient-derived xenografts of LBC. Experimental design: Two LBC xenografts (HBCx22 and HBCx34) were treated with different endocrine therapies (ET) to obtain xenografts with acquired resistances to tamoxifen (TamR) and ovariectomy (OvaR). PI3K pathway activation was analyzed by western blot and immunohistochemistry and responses to ET combined to everolimus were investigated in vivo. Gene expression analyses were performed by RT-PCR and Affymetrix arrays. Results: HBCx22 TamR xenograft was cross-resistant to several hormono-therapies, while HBCx22 OvaR and HBCx34 TamR exhibited a treatment specific resistance profile. PI3K pathway was similarly activated in parental and resistant xenografts but the addition of everolimus didn\'t restore the response to tamoxifen in TamR xenografts. By contrast, the combination of fulvestrant and everolimus induced tumor regression in vivo in HBCx34 TamR, where we found a cross-talk between ER and PI3K pathways. Expression of several ER-controlled genes and ER co-regulators was significantly changed in both TamR and OvaR tumors, indicating impaired ER transcriptional activity. Expression changes associated with hormono-resistance were both tumor and treatment specific and were enriched for genes involved in cell growth, cell death and cell survival. Conclusions: PDX models of LBC with acquired resistance to endocrine therapies show a great diversity of resistance phenotype, associated to specific deregulations of ER-mediated gene transcription. These models offer a tool for developing anticancer therapies and to investigate the dynamics of resistance emerging during pharmacological interventions.','2014','Jun','19','2014-06-24 21:06:50',NULL,1,1),(559,3,'blindmurray@gmail.com','24947863','1439-0531','Reproduction in domestic animals = Zuchthygiene','Causes, diagnosis and therapy of common diseases in neonatal puppies in the first days of life: cornerstones of practical approach.','© 2014 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.','Neonatal diseases and losses are a common and often unavoidable problem within breeding kennels. Altogether, morbidity and mortality ranges, according to the literature, from 5 to 35%. Among non-infectious causes besides hypoxia during birth, hypothermia, hypoglycaemia and dehydration are mostly responsible for puppy diseases and losses. Approximately 90% of all deaths in hypoxaemic pups occur during the first 2 days. Of 183 pups with hypoxia, 63 died, 92.7% of them within 48 h after birth. Among infectious causes, bacterial infection is the most common cause of neonatal mortality. Escherichia coli, streptococci, staphylococci, Pseudomonas sp., Klebsiella sp., Enterobacter sp. and some other micro-organisms are regularly involved in neonatal infections. Post-mortem findings especially document E. coli, Staphylococcus sp. and Streptococcus sp. as responsible bacteria. The dam and the environment are suspected as sources of neonatal infections as it was shown by genetic relatedness of responsible bacterial strains isolated in both puppies and their dams. From a total of 517 puppies with bacterial infections, the treatment results documented that parenteral administration of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid in 308 neonates showed the best result. Diagnosis of diseases is often made difficult by the absence of variability in clinical signs contrary to adult dogs. Findings during a physical examination in pups differ from those in adults.

The pathophysiology remains unclear, although evidence exists that surgical trauma and the use of cardiopulmonary bypass provoke an immune response leading to PPS. We hypothesized that an intraoperative dose of dexamethasone decreases the risk of PPS, by reducing this inflammatory response.\r\nMETHODS:\r\nWe performed a subanalysis of the DECS study, which is a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial of 4,494 patients undergoing cardiac surgery with use of cardiopulmonary bypass. The aim of the DECS study was to investigate whether a single intraoperative dose of 1 mg/kg dexamethasone reduced the incidence of a composite of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, renal failure, or respiratory failure, within 30 days of randomization. In this substudy, we retrospectively analyzed the occurrence of PPS in 822 patients who were included in the DECS trial and underwent valvular surgery. Postpericardiotomy syndrome was diagnosed if 2 of 5 listed symptoms were present: unexplained fever, pleuritic chest pain, pericardial or pleural rub, new or worsening pericardial or pleural effusion. All medical charts, x-rays, and echocardiograms were reviewed. Secondary end point was the occurrence of complicated PPS, defined as PPS with need for evacuation of pleural effusion, pericardiocentesis, and tamponade requiring intervention or hospital readmission for PPS. This is a blinded, single-center, post hoc analysis.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nPostpericardiotomy syndrome occurred in 119 patients (14.5%). The incidence of PPS after dexamethasone compared with placebo was 13.5% vs 15.5% (relative risk 0.88, 95% CI 0.63-1.22). For complicated PPS, the incidence was 3.8% versus 3.2% (relative risk 1.17, 95% CI 0.57-2.41, P = .66), respectively.\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\nIn patients undergoing valvular cardiac surgery, high-dose dexamethasone treatment had no protective effect on the occurrence of PPS or complicated PPS.','2014','Jul','','2014-06-24 21:09:10',NULL,1,1),(562,1,'nick@masomurray.com','24951538','1755-3245','Cardiovascular research','Expression of fibulin-6 in failing hearts and its role for cardiac fibroblast migration.','Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology. All rights reserved. © The Author 2014. For permissions please email: journals.permissions@oup.com.','\r\nAIMS:\r\nThe cardiac extracellular matrix (ECM) undergoes a dynamic transition following myocardial infarction. Fibulin-6, an ECM protein is expressed in cell junctions particularly in tissues subjected to significant mechanical stress. Fibulin-6 deficiency results in defective cell migration in nematodes and early embryonic lethality in mice. The role of fibulin-6 in healthy and failing myocardium has not been described. We have examined the expression and distribution pattern of fibulin-6 during myocardial remodeling (MR) and detailed its effect on the migratory function of cardiac fibroblasts (CF) in response to TGF-β1.\r\nMETHODS AND RESULTS:\r\nIn healthy murine myocardium fibulin-6 expression is largely confined to larger coronary arteries. It is induced during the early and the late phase of remodeling after infarction in murine hearts predominantly in the scar-muscle junction. Similar results are obtained in human ischemic cardiomyopathy. Fibulin-6 is mostly expressed in close vicinity to vimentin positive cells and is also abundantly expressed in vitro in cultured neonatal CF. TGF-β1 does not induce smooth muscle actin in fibroblasts deficient of fibulin-6, which also compromised their migration. Cells that had migrated expressed more fibulin-6 compared to stationary cells. Plated on fibulin-6 depleted matrix, stress fiber induction in fibroblast in response to TGF-β1 was impaired. In ex vivo explant cultures from postinfarct myocardium, the number of emigrating fibroblasts was also significantly reduced by fibulin-6 siRNA knock down (KD).\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\nFibulin-6, a fibroblast released ECM protein may play an important role during myocardial remodeling by imparting an effect on cardiac fibroblast migration in close and complementary interplay with TGF-β1 signalling.','2014','Jun','20','2014-06-24 21:09:10',NULL,1,1),(563,1,'nick@masomurray.com','24948576','1569-9285','Interactive cardiovascular and thoracic surgery','Computational fluid dynamics of the right ventricular outflow tract and of the pulmonary artery: a bench model of flow dynamics.','© The Author 2014.

The reoperation rate at 5 years can be as high as 25% and depends on age, type of conduit, conduit diameter and principal heart malformation. The aim of this study is to provide a bench model with computer fluid dynamics to analyse the haemodynamics of the RVOT, pulmonary artery, its bifurcation, and left and right pulmonary arteries that in the future may serve as a tool for analysis and prediction of outcome following RVOT reconstruction.\r\nMETHODS:\r\nPressure, flow and diameter at the RVOT, pulmonary artery, bifurcation of the pulmonary artery, and left and right pulmonary arteries were measured in five normal pigs with a mean weight of 24.6 ± 0.89 kg. Data obtained were used for a 3D computer fluid-dynamics simulation of flow conditions, focusing on the pressure, flow and shear stress profile of the pulmonary trunk to the level of the left and right pulmonary arteries.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nThree inlet steady flow profiles were obtained at 0.2, 0.29 and 0.36 m/s that correspond to the flow rates of 1.5, 2.0 and 2.5 l/min flow at the RVOT. The flow velocity profile was constant at the RVOT down to the bifurcation and decreased at the left and right pulmonary arteries. In all three inlet velocity profiles, low sheer stress and low-velocity areas were detected along the left wall of the pulmonary artery, at the pulmonary artery bifurcation and at the ostia of both pulmonary arteries.\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\nThis computed fluid real-time model provides us with a realistic picture of fluid dynamics in the pulmonary tract area. Deep shear stress areas correspond to a turbulent flow profile that is a predictive factor for the development of vessel wall arteriosclerosis. We believe that this bench model may be a useful tool for further evaluation of RVOT pathology following surgical reconstructions.','2014','Jun','19','2014-06-24 21:09:10',NULL,1,1),(564,1,'nick@masomurray.com','24937347','1526-7598','Anesthesia and analgesia','The Long-Term Impact of Early Cardiovascular Therapy Intensification for Postoperative Troponin Elevation after Major Vascular Surgery.','','\r\nBACKGROUND::\r\nAcute cardiac events are a frequent cause of morbidity after vascular surgery. The impact of early evidence-based treatment for patients with an acute cardiac event after vascular surgery on long-term postoperative outcomes has not been extensively studied. We hypothesized that providing appropriate evidence-based treatment to patients with elevated postoperative cardiac troponin levels may limit long-term mortality.\r\nMETHODS::\r\nWe conducted a study of 667 consecutive major vascular surgery patients with an elevated postoperative troponin I level. We then determined which of these patients received medical therapy as per the 2007 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association recommendations for the medical management of patients with chronic stable angina. All patients with troponin elevation were then matched with 2 control patients without postoperative troponin elevation. Matching was done using logistic regression and nearest-neighbor matching methods. The primary study end point was 12 months survival without a major cardiac event (i.e., death, myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, or pulmonary edema requiring hospitalization).\r\nRESULTS::\r\nTherapy was intensified in 43 of 66 patients (65%) who suffered a troponin I elevation after surgery. Patients with a troponin I elevation not receiving intensified cardiovascular treatment had a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.77 (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.13-2.42; P = 0.004) for the primary study outcome as compared with the control group. In contrast, patients with a troponin I elevation who received intensified cardiovascular treatment had an HR of 0.63 (95% CI, 0.10-1.19; P = 0.45) for the primary outcome as compared with the control group.

The type of procedure, perioperative antiplatelet therapy, and other patient-related factors influence the risk of postoperative haemorrhage. Our objective was to analyze the postoperative risk factors for hemorrhagic complications and to determine the impact of antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy strategies on postoperative bleeding risk in patients with coronary stents undergoing non-cardiac surgery.\r\nPATIENTS AND METHODS:\r\nProspective, multicentre observational cohort study of 1134 consecutive patients with coronary stents undergoing non-cardiac surgery between April 2007 and April 2009. The primary outcome measure was the occurrence of an hemorrhagic complication during the first 30days following the surgery or intervention.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nAmong the 1134 patients evaluated, 108 (9.5%) experienced a postoperative hemorrhagic complication (with a median time to occurrence of 5.3days). These complications were considered major, involved the operative site, and required reoperation in 92 (85.2%), 92 (85.2%), and 20 (18.5%) of patients, respectively. Mortality in patients with a haemorrhagic complication was 12% (n=13). Independent postoperative factors associated with haemorrhagic complications were identified as a high and intermediate bleeding risk procedure and the use and dose of anticoagulants.

Significant systemic arterial hypotension occurred in 14 individuals (26%) and oxygen desaturation in 9 (17%) patients. Administration of an intravenous (IV) vasopressor agent during induction significantly decreased the incidence of hypotension. The type of IV induction agent did not influence hemodynamic alterations, though patients who received propofol experienced a trend towards increased hypotension (83% of pts) when a vasopressor was not used. Inhalational induction, regardless of vasopressor use, was more likely to result in hypotension (60% of pts). The 30-day mortality was 3.8% (two pts). Both patients had minor elective procedures with monitored anesthesia care (MAC).\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\nHypotension is more common in patients with Eisenmenger syndrome and similar physiology when a vasopressor is not used during the peri-induction period, regardless of induction agent. Etomidate tended to have better hemodynamic stability than other induction agents. The use of a vasopressor is recommended. We present general recommendations for anesthesiologists and strongly recommend use of a vasopressor before or during induction to reduce hypotension along with complete avoidance of inhalational induction. Further, MAC anesthesia has been associated with perioperative and 30-day mortality.','2014','Jun','4','2014-06-24 21:09:10',NULL,1,1),(569,1,'nick@masomurray.com','24906370','2047-9980','Journal of the American Heart Association','Assessment of a university of california, los angeles 4-variable risk score for advanced heart failure.','© 2014 The Authors.

While donor identity of DNA extracted directly from blood collected in standard tubes containing anticoagulants can be easily verified by generating STR profiles, RNA from blood collected in PAXgene Blood RNA tubes (PAXgene RNA tubes) is depleted of DNA and is not amenable to STR fingerprinting for donor identity verification. We investigated the feasibility of isolating DNA directly from blood collected in PAXgene RNA tubes for use as template for STR DNA fingerprinting for blood donor identity verification. We determined that DNA extraction can be performed manually with the QIAamp DNA Blood Minikit or on the QIAxtractor instrument with minimal pre-processing protocol additions, and that DNA isolated from blood collected in PAXgene RNA tubes is of sufficient quantity and quality for successful STR fingerprint analysis.

We therefore aimed to investigate the effects of isoflurane anesthesia on cognitive dysfunction in a diabetic rat model induced by a single injection of streptozotocin (STZ).

Simple rotation of the catheter, echocardiography-guided placement to the centre of the ventricle, or ventricular expansion through crystalloid infusion may correct for these artifacts. Fluid administration, however, alters left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and volume and therefore stroke volume, thereby obscuring continuous real-time haemodynamic measurements.\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\nPressure-volume artifacts during inotropic infusion are caused by physical contact of the catheter with endocardium.

Myocardial infarction and stroke have been detected essentially in the early phase of the disease, i.e. within 48 hours from hospital admission, with an incidence ranging from as low as 1% to as high as 11%. Age, previous cardiovascular events and high pneumonia severity index were independent predictors of myocardial infarction; clinical predictors of stroke were not identified. Deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism may also occur after pneumonia but incidence and clinical predictors must be defined. Biological plausibility of such association may be deduced by experimental and clinical studies, showing that lung infection is complicated by platelet aggregation and clotting system activation, as documented by up-regulation of Tissue Factor and down-regulation of activated Protein C.

However, treatment programs for chronic pain typically take a rehabilitative approach, emphasizing decreasing pain-related disability first with the expectation that pain reduction will follow. This information is routinely provided to patients yet no studies have systematically examined the actual trajectories of pain and disability in a clinical care setting. In this study of youth with chronic pain (N=94, 8-18 years), it was hypothesized that 1) functional disability and pain would decrease over the course of psychological treatment for chronic pain and 2) functional disability would decrease more quickly than pain intensity. Participants received cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for pain management (M = 5.6 sessions) plus standard medical care. The Functional Disability Inventory and a Numeric Rating Scale of average pain intensity were completed by the child at every CBT session. Hierarchical linear modeling was conducted to examine the longitudinal trajectories of disability and pain. Standardized estimates of the slopes of change were obtained to test differences in rates of change between pain and disability. Results showed an overall significant decline in functional disability over time. While pain scores reduced slightly from pre- to post-treatment, the longitudinal decline over treatment was not statistically significant.

Mast cell carboxypeptidase A (MC-CPA) is released solely from MCs and plays a critical role in degrading toxins and endothelin 1 (ET-1). The present study sought to explore whether MC-CPA is involved in the process of IPC in a rodent model of small intestinal ischemia reperfusion (IIR) injury.\r\nMATERIALS AND METHODS:\r\nIIR injuries were induced in Sprague-Dawley rats by clamping the superior mesenteric artery for 60 min followed by reperfusion for 2 h. One cycle of 10 min intestinal ischemia and 10 min of reperfusion was used in the IPC group, and the MC stabilizer cromolyn sodium and MC potato carboxypeptidase inhibitor were administered before the start of IPC. At the end of experiment, intestine tissue was obtained for assays of the MC-CPA3, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, and ET-1 contents and myeloperoxidase activities. Intestinal histologic injury scores and MC degranulation were assessed. Apoptosis indices and cleaved caspase- 3 protein expressions were quantified.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nIIR resulted in severe injury, as evidenced by significant increases in injury scores and MC-CPA3, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, and ET-1 contents that were accompanied with concomitant elevations in cleaved caspase 3 expression, apoptosis indices, and myeloperoxidase activities. IPC induced a significant increase in MC-CPA3, induced MC degranulation, and attenuated IIR injury by downregulating IIR-induced biochemical changes, whereas cromolyn sodium and potato carboxypeptidase inhibitor abolished the IPC-mediated changes.\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\nThese data suggest that IPC protected against IIR injury via the MC degranulation-mediated release of MC-CPA.','2014','May','23','2014-06-24 21:09:13',NULL,1,1),(600,2,'nickm@masomurray.com','24953890','1523-6838','American journal of kidney diseases : the official journal of the National Kidney Foundation','Serum Bicarbonate Concentrations and Kidney Disease Progression in Community-Living Elders: The Health, Aging, and Body Composition (Health ABC) Study.','Published by Elsevier Inc.','\r\nBACKGROUND:\r\nIn populations with prevalent chronic kidney disease (CKD), lower serum bicarbonate levels are associated with more rapid CKD progression, but whether lower bicarbonate levels also are associated with risk of incident estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)\r\nSTUDY DESIGN:\r\nLongitudinal observational cohort study.\r\nSETTING & PARTICIPANTS:\r\nWell-functioning community-living elders aged 70-79 years at inception.\r\nPREDICTOR:\r\nSerum bicarbonate level measured at the time of collection by arterialized venous blood sample using an arterial blood gas analyzer.\r\nOUTCOMES:\r\nChange in eGFR over 7 years, and new eGFR\r\nMEASUREMENTS:\r\nLinear and logistic regressions were used to evaluate associations of baseline serum bicarbonate level with change in eGFR and incident eGFR\r\nRESULTS:\r\nAt baseline, mean eGFR was 84±16 (SD)mL/min/1.73m(2), and serum bicarbonate level was 25.2±1.9mmol/L.

The present study aimed to define the role of FoxO1 in the regulation of NaV1.5 expression and cardiac Na(+) channel activity in mouse ventricular cardiomyocytes and assess the cardiac electrophysiological phenotype of mice with cardiac FoxO1 deletion. Tamoxifen-induced and cardiac-specific FoxO1 deletion was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Cardiac FoxO1 deletion failed to result in either cardiac functional changes or hypertrophy as assessed by echocardiography and individual ventricular cell capacitances, respectively. Western blotting showed that FoxO1 was significantly decreased while NaV1.5 protein level was significantly increased in mouse hearts with FoxO1 deletion. Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) revealed that FoxO1 deletion led to an increase in NaV1.5 and Na(+) channel subunit β3 mRNA, but not β1, 2, 4, or connexin 43. Whole patch-clamp recordings demonstrated that cardiac Na(+) currents were significantly augmented by FoxO1 deletion without affecting the steady-state activation and inactivation, leading to accelerated depolarization of action potentials in mouse ventricular cardiomyocytes. Electrocardiogram recordings showed that the QRS complex was significantly shortened and P wave amplitude was significantly increased in conscious and unrestrained mice with cardiac FoxO1 deletion. NaV1.5 expression was decreased in the peri-infarct (border-zone) of mice with myocardial infarction and FoxO1 accumulated in the cardiomyocyte nuclei of chronic ischemic human hearts. Our findings indicate that FoxO1 plays an important role in the regulation of NaV1.5 and β3 subunit expression as well as Na(+) channel activity in the heart and that FoxO1 is involved in the modulation of NaV1.5 expression in ischemic heart disease.','2014','Jun','20','2014-06-24 21:09:17',NULL,1,1),(602,3,'blindmurray@gmail.com','24955355','2314-6141','BioMed research international','Recombinant Human Factor IX Produced from Transgenic Porcine Milk.','','Production of biopharmaceuticals from transgenic animal milk is a cost-effective method for highly complex proteins that cannot be efficiently produced using conventional systems such as microorganisms or animal cells.

The rhFIX protein was purified from transgenic porcine milk using a three-column purification scheme after a precipitation step to remove casein. The purified protein had high specific activity and a low ratio of the active form (FIXa). The purified rhFIX had 11.9 γ-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) residues/mol protein, which approached full occupancy of the 12 potential sites in the Gla domain. The rhFIX was shown to have a higher isoelectric point and lower sialic acid content than plasma-derived FIX (pdFIX). The rhFIX had the same N-glycosylation sites and phosphorylation sites as pdFIX, but had a higher specific activity. These results suggest that rhFIX produced from porcine milk is physiologically active and they support the use of transgenic animals as bioreactors for industrial scale production in milk.','2014','','','2014-06-24 21:09:17',NULL,1,1),(603,3,'blindmurray@gmail.com','24955272','2090-6803','Case reports in pediatrics','Septic bursitis in an 8-year-old boy.','','Background.

The purpose of this work was to test the possibility that the facilitation of lordosis behavior in estrogen-primed rats by progesterone (P) and its 5α- and 5β-reduced metabolites, gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH), leptin, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and vagino-cervical stimulation (VCS) involves interactions with classical ERs by using the selective ER modulator, tamoxifen. To further assess the role of ERs, we also explored the effects of the pure ER antagonist, ICI182780 (ICI), on estrous behavior induced by P and GnRH. Ovariectomized, estrogen-primed rats (5 μg estradiol benzoate 40 hr earlier) were injected intraventricularly with the above-mentioned compounds, or they received VCS. All compounds and VCS effectively facilitated estrous behavior when tested at 60, 120 or 240 min after infusion or application of VCS. Intraventricular infusion of tamoxifen (5 μg), 30 min prior, significantly attenuated estrous behaviors induced in estradiol-primed rats by P, most of its 5α- and 5β-reduced metabolites, GnRH, and PGE2, but not by VCS. Although there was a trend for reduction, tamoxifen did not significantly decrease lordosis in females treated with 5β-pregnan-3,20-dione. ICI also inhibited lordosis behavior induced by P and GnRH at some testing intervals. These results suggest that activation of classical ERs participates in the triggering effects on estrous behavior induced by agents with different chemical structures that do not bind directly to ERs.','2014','Jun','19','2014-06-24 21:09:17',NULL,1,1),(606,3,'blindmurray@gmail.com','24954165','1872-6623','Pain','Differential changes in functional disability and pain intensity over the course of psychological treatment for children with chronic pain.','Copyright © 2014.

However, treatment programs for chronic pain typically take a rehabilitative approach, emphasizing decreasing pain-related disability first with the expectation that pain reduction will follow. This information is routinely provided to patients yet no studies have systematically examined the actual trajectories of pain and disability in a clinical care setting. In this study of youth with chronic pain (N=94, 8-18 years), it was hypothesized that 1) functional disability and pain would decrease over the course of psychological treatment for chronic pain and 2) functional disability would decrease more quickly than pain intensity. Participants received cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for pain management (M = 5.6 sessions) plus standard medical care. The Functional Disability Inventory and a Numeric Rating Scale of average pain intensity were completed by the child at every CBT session. Hierarchical linear modeling was conducted to examine the longitudinal trajectories of disability and pain. Standardized estimates of the slopes of change were obtained to test differences in rates of change between pain and disability. Results showed an overall significant decline in functional disability over time. While pain scores reduced slightly from pre- to post-treatment, the longitudinal decline over treatment was not statistically significant. As expected, the rate of change of disability was significantly more rapid than pain. Evidence for variability in treatment response was noted suggesting the need for additional research into individual trajectories of change in pediatric pain treatment.','2014','Jun','19','2014-06-24 21:09:17',NULL,1,1),(607,3,'blindmurray@gmail.com','24953887','1528-8447','The journal of pain : official journal of the American Pain Society','The economic costs of chronic pain among a cohort of treatment seeking adolescents in the United States.','Copyright © 2014 American Pain Society.

However, the minimal blood volume for effective processing under clinically relevant conditions has yet to be determined.\r\nSTUDY DESIGN AND METHODS:\r\nFresh blood from volunteer donations adjusted to a hematocrit (Hct) of 10% was used to test ELECTA (Sorin) equipped with a 55-mL bowl, C.A.T.S (Fresenius) in the pediatric program mode, and OrthoPAT (Haemonetics). Twenty-milliliter portions of red blood cells (RBCs) were added and processed under various conditions, including clinically relevant first filling and intermittent emptying. RBC recovery and availability and plasma elimination were calculated from the Hct, free hemoglobin, and total protein.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nThe main impediment to recovery and availability was the first filling. There, RBC recovery was significantly reduced, while it subsequently varied between 93 and 98%. To produce the first 30 mL of RBCs, ELECTA required 42 mL and C.A.T.S and OrthoPAT 62 mL owing to the dead space of the separation chamber or reservoir, respectively. RBC availability was much higher in subsequent processes, with only minimal differences between the three devices. They all consistently provided high plasma elimination rates.\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\nThe continuous system showed no advantage over a small Latham bowl. From the results it can be calculated that the limit for feasible cell salvage at present is an infant of 6 months.

Methods : The records of patients operated on for a perforated duodenal ulcer in the last 8 years in two pediatric surgery centers were evaluated retrospectively. Patient demographics, symptoms, time to admission to hospital, operative findings, and postoperative clinical course were evaluated. Results : Nine children (mean age 13.2 years, range 6-170 years) were included. All patients were admitted in the first six hours after their abdominal pain started.

We investigated the molecular changes associated with acquired hormono-resistances in patient-derived xenografts of LBC. Experimental design: Two LBC xenografts (HBCx22 and HBCx34) were treated with different endocrine therapies (ET) to obtain xenografts with acquired resistances to tamoxifen (TamR) and ovariectomy (OvaR). PI3K pathway activation was analyzed by western blot and immunohistochemistry and responses to ET combined to everolimus were investigated in vivo. Gene expression analyses were performed by RT-PCR and Affymetrix arrays. Results: HBCx22 TamR xenograft was cross-resistant to several hormono-therapies, while HBCx22 OvaR and HBCx34 TamR exhibited a treatment specific resistance profile. PI3K pathway was similarly activated in parental and resistant xenografts but the addition of everolimus didn\'t restore the response to tamoxifen in TamR xenografts. By contrast, the combination of fulvestrant and everolimus induced tumor regression in vivo in HBCx34 TamR, where we found a cross-talk between ER and PI3K pathways. Expression of several ER-controlled genes and ER co-regulators was significantly changed in both TamR and OvaR tumors, indicating impaired ER transcriptional activity. Expression changes associated with hormono-resistance were both tumor and treatment specific and were enriched for genes involved in cell growth, cell death and cell survival. Conclusions: PDX models of LBC with acquired resistance to endocrine therapies show a great diversity of resistance phenotype, associated to specific deregulations of ER-mediated gene transcription. These models offer a tool for developing anticancer therapies and to investigate the dynamics of resistance emerging during pharmacological interventions.','2014','Jun','19','2014-06-24 21:09:17',NULL,1,1),(619,3,'blindmurray@gmail.com','24947863','1439-0531','Reproduction in domestic animals = Zuchthygiene','Causes, diagnosis and therapy of common diseases in neonatal puppies in the first days of life: cornerstones of practical approach.','© 2014 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.','Neonatal diseases and losses are a common and often unavoidable problem within breeding kennels. Altogether, morbidity and mortality ranges, according to the literature, from 5 to 35%. Among non-infectious causes besides hypoxia during birth, hypothermia, hypoglycaemia and dehydration are mostly responsible for puppy diseases and losses. Approximately 90% of all deaths in hypoxaemic pups occur during the first 2 days. Of 183 pups with hypoxia, 63 died, 92.7% of them within 48 h after birth. Among infectious causes, bacterial infection is the most common cause of neonatal mortality. Escherichia coli, streptococci, staphylococci, Pseudomonas sp., Klebsiella sp., Enterobacter sp. and some other micro-organisms are regularly involved in neonatal infections. Post-mortem findings especially document E. coli, Staphylococcus sp. and Streptococcus sp. as responsible bacteria. The dam and the environment are suspected as sources of neonatal infections as it was shown by genetic relatedness of responsible bacterial strains isolated in both puppies and their dams. From a total of 517 puppies with bacterial infections, the treatment results documented that parenteral administration of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid in 308 neonates showed the best result. Diagnosis of diseases is often made difficult by the absence of variability in clinical signs contrary to adult dogs. Findings during a physical examination in pups differ from those in adults. Furthermore, treatment recommendations have to meet the special conditions in neonates concerning drug metabolism and excretion.','2014','Jun','','2014-06-24 21:09:17',NULL,1,1),(620,3,'blindmurray@gmail.com','24947736','1471-2431','BMC pediatrics','Haemophilus influenzae type b as an important cause of culture-positive acute otitis media in young children in Thailand: a tympanocentesis-based, multi-center, cross-sectional study.','','\r\nBACKGROUND:\r\nStreptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) and Haemophilus influenzae (H. influenzae) are considered major causes of bacterial acute otitis media (AOM) worldwide, but data from Asia on primary causes of AOM are limited.

The most common pneumococcal serotypes were 19 F (26%) and 14 (22%). The majority of H. influenzae isolates were encapsulated (18/21), with 13 type b (Hib) representing 62% of all H. influenzae isolate or 11% of all samples (13/118), and there were only 3 non-typeable isolates.

The pathophysiology remains unclear, although evidence exists that surgical trauma and the use of cardiopulmonary bypass provoke an immune response leading to PPS. We hypothesized that an intraoperative dose of dexamethasone decreases the risk of PPS, by reducing this inflammatory response.\r\nMETHODS:\r\nWe performed a subanalysis of the DECS study, which is a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial of 4,494 patients undergoing cardiac surgery with use of cardiopulmonary bypass. The aim of the DECS study was to investigate whether a single intraoperative dose of 1 mg/kg dexamethasone reduced the incidence of a composite of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, renal failure, or respiratory failure, within 30 days of randomization. In this substudy, we retrospectively analyzed the occurrence of PPS in 822 patients who were included in the DECS trial and underwent valvular surgery. Postpericardiotomy syndrome was diagnosed if 2 of 5 listed symptoms were present: unexplained fever, pleuritic chest pain, pericardial or pleural rub, new or worsening pericardial or pleural effusion. All medical charts, x-rays, and echocardiograms were reviewed. Secondary end point was the occurrence of complicated PPS, defined as PPS with need for evacuation of pleural effusion, pericardiocentesis, and tamponade requiring intervention or hospital readmission for PPS. This is a blinded, single-center, post hoc analysis.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nPostpericardiotomy syndrome occurred in 119 patients (14.5%). The incidence of PPS after dexamethasone compared with placebo was 13.5% vs 15.5% (relative risk 0.88, 95% CI 0.63-1.22). For complicated PPS, the incidence was 3.8% versus 3.2% (relative risk 1.17, 95% CI 0.57-2.41, P = .66), respectively.\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\nIn patients undergoing valvular cardiac surgery, high-dose dexamethasone treatment had no protective effect on the occurrence of PPS or complicated PPS.','2014','Jul','','2014-06-24 21:15:07',NULL,1,1),(622,1,'nick@masomurray.com','24951538','1755-3245','Cardiovascular research','Expression of fibulin-6 in failing hearts and its role for cardiac fibroblast migration.','Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology. All rights reserved. © The Author 2014. For permissions please email: journals.permissions@oup.com.','\r\nAIMS:\r\nThe cardiac extracellular matrix (ECM) undergoes a dynamic transition following myocardial infarction. Fibulin-6, an ECM protein is expressed in cell junctions particularly in tissues subjected to significant mechanical stress. Fibulin-6 deficiency results in defective cell migration in nematodes and early embryonic lethality in mice. The role of fibulin-6 in healthy and failing myocardium has not been described. We have examined the expression and distribution pattern of fibulin-6 during myocardial remodeling (MR) and detailed its effect on the migratory function of cardiac fibroblasts (CF) in response to TGF-β1.\r\nMETHODS AND RESULTS:\r\nIn healthy murine myocardium fibulin-6 expression is largely confined to larger coronary arteries. It is induced during the early and the late phase of remodeling after infarction in murine hearts predominantly in the scar-muscle junction. Similar results are obtained in human ischemic cardiomyopathy. Fibulin-6 is mostly expressed in close vicinity to vimentin positive cells and is also abundantly expressed in vitro in cultured neonatal CF. TGF-β1 does not induce smooth muscle actin in fibroblasts deficient of fibulin-6, which also compromised their migration. Cells that had migrated expressed more fibulin-6 compared to stationary cells. Plated on fibulin-6 depleted matrix, stress fiber induction in fibroblast in response to TGF-β1 was impaired. In ex vivo explant cultures from postinfarct myocardium, the number of emigrating fibroblasts was also significantly reduced by fibulin-6 siRNA knock down (KD).\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\nFibulin-6, a fibroblast released ECM protein may play an important role during myocardial remodeling by imparting an effect on cardiac fibroblast migration in close and complementary interplay with TGF-β1 signalling.','2014','Jun','20','2014-06-24 21:15:07',NULL,1,1),(623,1,'nick@masomurray.com','24948576','1569-9285','Interactive cardiovascular and thoracic surgery','Computational fluid dynamics of the right ventricular outflow tract and of the pulmonary artery: a bench model of flow dynamics.','© The Author 2014.

The reoperation rate at 5 years can be as high as 25% and depends on age, type of conduit, conduit diameter and principal heart malformation. The aim of this study is to provide a bench model with computer fluid dynamics to analyse the haemodynamics of the RVOT, pulmonary artery, its bifurcation, and left and right pulmonary arteries that in the future may serve as a tool for analysis and prediction of outcome following RVOT reconstruction.\r\nMETHODS:\r\nPressure, flow and diameter at the RVOT, pulmonary artery, bifurcation of the pulmonary artery, and left and right pulmonary arteries were measured in five normal pigs with a mean weight of 24.6 ± 0.89 kg. Data obtained were used for a 3D computer fluid-dynamics simulation of flow conditions, focusing on the pressure, flow and shear stress profile of the pulmonary trunk to the level of the left and right pulmonary arteries.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nThree inlet steady flow profiles were obtained at 0.2, 0.29 and 0.36 m/s that correspond to the flow rates of 1.5, 2.0 and 2.5 l/min flow at the RVOT. The flow velocity profile was constant at the RVOT down to the bifurcation and decreased at the left and right pulmonary arteries. In all three inlet velocity profiles, low sheer stress and low-velocity areas were detected along the left wall of the pulmonary artery, at the pulmonary artery bifurcation and at the ostia of both pulmonary arteries.\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\nThis computed fluid real-time model provides us with a realistic picture of fluid dynamics in the pulmonary tract area. Deep shear stress areas correspond to a turbulent flow profile that is a predictive factor for the development of vessel wall arteriosclerosis. We believe that this bench model may be a useful tool for further evaluation of RVOT pathology following surgical reconstructions.','2014','Jun','19','2014-06-24 21:15:07',NULL,1,1),(624,1,'nick@masomurray.com','24937347','1526-7598','Anesthesia and analgesia','The Long-Term Impact of Early Cardiovascular Therapy Intensification for Postoperative Troponin Elevation after Major Vascular Surgery.','','\r\nBACKGROUND::\r\nAcute cardiac events are a frequent cause of morbidity after vascular surgery. The impact of early evidence-based treatment for patients with an acute cardiac event after vascular surgery on long-term postoperative outcomes has not been extensively studied. We hypothesized that providing appropriate evidence-based treatment to patients with elevated postoperative cardiac troponin levels may limit long-term mortality.\r\nMETHODS::\r\nWe conducted a study of 667 consecutive major vascular surgery patients with an elevated postoperative troponin I level. We then determined which of these patients received medical therapy as per the 2007 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association recommendations for the medical management of patients with chronic stable angina. All patients with troponin elevation were then matched with 2 control patients without postoperative troponin elevation. Matching was done using logistic regression and nearest-neighbor matching methods. The primary study end point was 12 months survival without a major cardiac event (i.e., death, myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, or pulmonary edema requiring hospitalization).\r\nRESULTS::\r\nTherapy was intensified in 43 of 66 patients (65%) who suffered a troponin I elevation after surgery.

The type of procedure, perioperative antiplatelet therapy, and other patient-related factors influence the risk of postoperative haemorrhage. Our objective was to analyze the postoperative risk factors for hemorrhagic complications and to determine the impact of antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy strategies on postoperative bleeding risk in patients with coronary stents undergoing non-cardiac surgery.\r\nPATIENTS AND METHODS:\r\nProspective, multicentre observational cohort study of 1134 consecutive patients with coronary stents undergoing non-cardiac surgery between April 2007 and April 2009. The primary outcome measure was the occurrence of an hemorrhagic complication during the first 30days following the surgery or intervention.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nAmong the 1134 patients evaluated, 108 (9.5%) experienced a postoperative hemorrhagic complication (with a median time to occurrence of 5.3days). These complications were considered major, involved the operative site, and required reoperation in 92 (85.2%), 92 (85.2%), and 20 (18.5%) of patients, respectively. Mortality in patients with a haemorrhagic complication was 12% (n=13). Independent postoperative factors associated with haemorrhagic complications were identified as a high and intermediate bleeding risk procedure and the use and dose of anticoagulants.

Significant systemic arterial hypotension occurred in 14 individuals (26%) and oxygen desaturation in 9 (17%) patients. Administration of an intravenous (IV) vasopressor agent during induction significantly decreased the incidence of hypotension. The type of IV induction agent did not influence hemodynamic alterations, though patients who received propofol experienced a trend towards increased hypotension (83% of pts) when a vasopressor was not used. Inhalational induction, regardless of vasopressor use, was more likely to result in hypotension (60% of pts). The 30-day mortality was 3.8% (two pts). Both patients had minor elective procedures with monitored anesthesia care (MAC).\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\nHypotension is more common in patients with Eisenmenger syndrome and similar physiology when a vasopressor is not used during the peri-induction period, regardless of induction agent. Etomidate tended to have better hemodynamic stability than other induction agents. The use of a vasopressor is recommended. We present general recommendations for anesthesiologists and strongly recommend use of a vasopressor before or during induction to reduce hypotension along with complete avoidance of inhalational induction.

While donor identity of DNA extracted directly from blood collected in standard tubes containing anticoagulants can be easily verified by generating STR profiles, RNA from blood collected in PAXgene Blood RNA tubes (PAXgene RNA tubes) is depleted of DNA and is not amenable to STR fingerprinting for donor identity verification. We investigated the feasibility of isolating DNA directly from blood collected in PAXgene RNA tubes for use as template for STR DNA fingerprinting for blood donor identity verification. We determined that DNA extraction can be performed manually with the QIAamp DNA Blood Minikit or on the QIAxtractor instrument with minimal pre-processing protocol additions, and that DNA isolated from blood collected in PAXgene RNA tubes is of sufficient quantity and quality for successful STR fingerprint analysis.

We therefore aimed to investigate the effects of isoflurane anesthesia on cognitive dysfunction in a diabetic rat model induced by a single injection of streptozotocin (STZ).

Simple rotation of the catheter, echocardiography-guided placement to the centre of the ventricle, or ventricular expansion through crystalloid infusion may correct for these artifacts. Fluid administration, however, alters left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and volume and therefore stroke volume, thereby obscuring continuous real-time haemodynamic measurements.\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\nPressure-volume artifacts during inotropic infusion are caused by physical contact of the catheter with endocardium.

Myocardial infarction and stroke have been detected essentially in the early phase of the disease, i.e. within 48 hours from hospital admission, with an incidence ranging from as low as 1% to as high as 11%. Age, previous cardiovascular events and high pneumonia severity index were independent predictors of myocardial infarction; clinical predictors of stroke were not identified. Deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism may also occur after pneumonia but incidence and clinical predictors must be defined. Biological plausibility of such association may be deduced by experimental and clinical studies, showing that lung infection is complicated by platelet aggregation and clotting system activation, as documented by up-regulation of Tissue Factor and down-regulation of activated Protein C. The effect of antithrombotic drugs have been examined in experimental and clinical studies but results are still inconclusive.

However, treatment programs for chronic pain typically take a rehabilitative approach, emphasizing decreasing pain-related disability first with the expectation that pain reduction will follow. This information is routinely provided to patients yet no studies have systematically examined the actual trajectories of pain and disability in a clinical care setting. In this study of youth with chronic pain (N=94, 8-18 years), it was hypothesized that 1) functional disability and pain would decrease over the course of psychological treatment for chronic pain and 2) functional disability would decrease more quickly than pain intensity. Participants received cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for pain management (M = 5.6 sessions) plus standard medical care. The Functional Disability Inventory and a Numeric Rating Scale of average pain intensity were completed by the child at every CBT session. Hierarchical linear modeling was conducted to examine the longitudinal trajectories of disability and pain. Standardized estimates of the slopes of change were obtained to test differences in rates of change between pain and disability. Results showed an overall significant decline in functional disability over time. While pain scores reduced slightly from pre- to post-treatment, the longitudinal decline over treatment was not statistically significant.

Published by Elsevier Ltd.','Our in vitro studies revealed that a transcription factor, Forkhead box protein O1 (FoxO1), negatively regulates the expression of NaV1.5, a main α subunit of the cardiac Na(+) channel, by altering the promoter activity of SCN5a in HL-1 cardiomyocytes. The in vivo role of FoxO1 in the regulation of cardiac NaV1.5 expression remains unknown. The present study aimed to define the role of FoxO1 in the regulation of NaV1.5 expression and cardiac Na(+) channel activity in mouse ventricular cardiomyocytes and assess the cardiac electrophysiological phenotype of mice with cardiac FoxO1 deletion. Tamoxifen-induced and cardiac-specific FoxO1 deletion was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Cardiac FoxO1 deletion failed to result in either cardiac functional changes or hypertrophy as assessed by echocardiography and individual ventricular cell capacitances, respectively. Western blotting showed that FoxO1 was significantly decreased while NaV1.5 protein level was significantly increased in mouse hearts with FoxO1 deletion. Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) revealed that FoxO1 deletion led to an increase in NaV1.5 and Na(+) channel subunit β3 mRNA, but not β1, 2, 4, or connexin 43. Whole patch-clamp recordings demonstrated that cardiac Na(+) currents were significantly augmented by FoxO1 deletion without affecting the steady-state activation and inactivation, leading to accelerated depolarization of action potentials in mouse ventricular cardiomyocytes. Electrocardiogram recordings showed that the QRS complex was significantly shortened and P wave amplitude was significantly increased in conscious and unrestrained mice with cardiac FoxO1 deletion. NaV1.5 expression was decreased in the peri-infarct (border-zone) of mice with myocardial infarction and FoxO1 accumulated in the cardiomyocyte nuclei of chronic ischemic human hearts. Our findings indicate that FoxO1 plays an important role in the regulation of NaV1.5 and β3 subunit expression as well as Na(+) channel activity in the heart and that FoxO1 is involved in the modulation of NaV1.5 expression in ischemic heart disease.','2014','Jun','20','2014-06-24 21:15:16',NULL,1,1),(662,3,'blindmurray@gmail.com','24955355','2314-6141','BioMed research international','Recombinant Human Factor IX Produced from Transgenic Porcine Milk.','','Production of biopharmaceuticals from transgenic animal milk is a cost-effective method for highly complex proteins that cannot be efficiently produced using conventional systems such as microorganisms or animal cells.

The purpose of this work was to test the possibility that the facilitation of lordosis behavior in estrogen-primed rats by progesterone (P) and its 5α- and 5β-reduced metabolites, gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH), leptin, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and vagino-cervical stimulation (VCS) involves interactions with classical ERs by using the selective ER modulator, tamoxifen. To further assess the role of ERs, we also explored the effects of the pure ER antagonist, ICI182780 (ICI), on estrous behavior induced by P and GnRH. Ovariectomized, estrogen-primed rats (5 μg estradiol benzoate 40 hr earlier) were injected intraventricularly with the above-mentioned compounds, or they received VCS. All compounds and VCS effectively facilitated estrous behavior when tested at 60, 120 or 240 min after infusion or application of VCS. Intraventricular infusion of tamoxifen (5 μg), 30 min prior, significantly attenuated estrous behaviors induced in estradiol-primed rats by P, most of its 5α- and 5β-reduced metabolites, GnRH, and PGE2, but not by VCS. Although there was a trend for reduction, tamoxifen did not significantly decrease lordosis in females treated with 5β-pregnan-3,20-dione.

However, treatment programs for chronic pain typically take a rehabilitative approach, emphasizing decreasing pain-related disability first with the expectation that pain reduction will follow. This information is routinely provided to patients yet no studies have systematically examined the actual trajectories of pain and disability in a clinical care setting. In this study of youth with chronic pain (N=94, 8-18 years), it was hypothesized that 1) functional disability and pain would decrease over the course of psychological treatment for chronic pain and 2) functional disability would decrease more quickly than pain intensity. Participants received cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for pain management (M = 5.6 sessions) plus standard medical care. The Functional Disability Inventory and a Numeric Rating Scale of average pain intensity were completed by the child at every CBT session. Hierarchical linear modeling was conducted to examine the longitudinal trajectories of disability and pain. Standardized estimates of the slopes of change were obtained to test differences in rates of change between pain and disability. Results showed an overall significant decline in functional disability over time. While pain scores reduced slightly from pre- to post-treatment, the longitudinal decline over treatment was not statistically significant. As expected, the rate of change of disability was significantly more rapid than pain. Evidence for variability in treatment response was noted suggesting the need for additional research into individual trajectories of change in pediatric pain treatment.','2014','Jun','19','2014-06-24 21:15:16',NULL,1,1),(667,3,'blindmurray@gmail.com','24953887','1528-8447','The journal of pain : official journal of the American Pain Society','The economic costs of chronic pain among a cohort of treatment seeking adolescents in the United States.','Copyright © 2014 American Pain Society.

Twenty-milliliter portions of red blood cells (RBCs) were added and processed under various conditions, including clinically relevant first filling and intermittent emptying. RBC recovery and availability and plasma elimination were calculated from the Hct, free hemoglobin, and total protein.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nThe main impediment to recovery and availability was the first filling. There, RBC recovery was significantly reduced, while it subsequently varied between 93 and 98%. To produce the first 30 mL of RBCs, ELECTA required 42 mL and C.A.T.S and OrthoPAT 62 mL owing to the dead space of the separation chamber or reservoir, respectively. RBC availability was much higher in subsequent processes, with only minimal differences between the three devices. They all consistently provided high plasma elimination rates.\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\nThe continuous system showed no advantage over a small Latham bowl.

Methods : The records of patients operated on for a perforated duodenal ulcer in the last 8 years in two pediatric surgery centers were evaluated retrospectively. Patient demographics, symptoms, time to admission to hospital, operative findings, and postoperative clinical course were evaluated. Results : Nine children (mean age 13.2 years, range 6-170 years) were included. All patients were admitted in the first six hours after their abdominal pain started.

Results: HBCx22 TamR xenograft was cross-resistant to several hormono-therapies, while HBCx22 OvaR and HBCx34 TamR exhibited a treatment specific resistance profile. PI3K pathway was similarly activated in parental and resistant xenografts but the addition of everolimus didn\'t restore the response to tamoxifen in TamR xenografts. By contrast, the combination of fulvestrant and everolimus induced tumor regression in vivo in HBCx34 TamR, where we found a cross-talk between ER and PI3K pathways. Expression of several ER-controlled genes and ER co-regulators was significantly changed in both TamR and OvaR tumors, indicating impaired ER transcriptional activity. Expression changes associated with hormono-resistance were both tumor and treatment specific and were enriched for genes involved in cell growth, cell death and cell survival. Conclusions: PDX models of LBC with acquired resistance to endocrine therapies show a great diversity of resistance phenotype, associated to specific deregulations of ER-mediated gene transcription. These models offer a tool for developing anticancer therapies and to investigate the dynamics of resistance emerging during pharmacological interventions.','2014','Jun','19','2014-06-24 21:15:16',NULL,1,1),(679,3,'blindmurray@gmail.com','24947863','1439-0531','Reproduction in domestic animals = Zuchthygiene','Causes, diagnosis and therapy of common diseases in neonatal puppies in the first days of life: cornerstones of practical approach.','© 2014 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.','Neonatal diseases and losses are a common and often unavoidable problem within breeding kennels. Altogether, morbidity and mortality ranges, according to the literature, from 5 to 35%. Among non-infectious causes besides hypoxia during birth, hypothermia, hypoglycaemia and dehydration are mostly responsible for puppy diseases and losses. Approximately 90% of all deaths in hypoxaemic pups occur during the first 2 days. Of 183 pups with hypoxia, 63 died, 92.7% of them within 48 h after birth. Among infectious causes, bacterial infection is the most common cause of neonatal mortality. Escherichia coli, streptococci, staphylococci, Pseudomonas sp., Klebsiella sp., Enterobacter sp. and some other micro-organisms are regularly involved in neonatal infections. Post-mortem findings especially document E. coli, Staphylococcus sp. and Streptococcus sp. as responsible bacteria. The dam and the environment are suspected as sources of neonatal infections as it was shown by genetic relatedness of responsible bacterial strains isolated in both puppies and their dams. From a total of 517 puppies with bacterial infections, the treatment results documented that parenteral administration of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid in 308 neonates showed the best result. Diagnosis of diseases is often made difficult by the absence of variability in clinical signs contrary to adult dogs. Findings during a physical examination in pups differ from those in adults. Furthermore, treatment recommendations have to meet the special conditions in neonates concerning drug metabolism and excretion.','2014','Jun','','2014-06-24 21:15:16',NULL,1,1),(680,3,'blindmurray@gmail.com','24947736','1471-2431','BMC pediatrics','Haemophilus influenzae type b as an important cause of culture-positive acute otitis media in young children in Thailand: a tympanocentesis-based, multi-center, cross-sectional study.','','\r\nBACKGROUND:\r\nStreptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) and Haemophilus influenzae (H. influenzae) are considered major causes of bacterial acute otitis media (AOM) worldwide, but data from Asia on primary causes of AOM are limited.

The pathophysiology remains unclear, although evidence exists that surgical trauma and the use of cardiopulmonary bypass provoke an immune response leading to PPS. We hypothesized that an intraoperative dose of dexamethasone decreases the risk of PPS, by reducing this inflammatory response.\r\nMETHODS:\r\nWe performed a subanalysis of the DECS study, which is a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial of 4,494 patients undergoing cardiac surgery with use of cardiopulmonary bypass. The aim of the DECS study was to investigate whether a single intraoperative dose of 1 mg/kg dexamethasone reduced the incidence of a composite of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, renal failure, or respiratory failure, within 30 days of randomization. In this substudy, we retrospectively analyzed the occurrence of PPS in 822 patients who were included in the DECS trial and underwent valvular surgery. Postpericardiotomy syndrome was diagnosed if 2 of 5 listed symptoms were present: unexplained fever, pleuritic chest pain, pericardial or pleural rub, new or worsening pericardial or pleural effusion. All medical charts, x-rays, and echocardiograms were reviewed. Secondary end point was the occurrence of complicated PPS, defined as PPS with need for evacuation of pleural effusion, pericardiocentesis, and tamponade requiring intervention or hospital readmission for PPS. This is a blinded, single-center, post hoc analysis.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nPostpericardiotomy syndrome occurred in 119 patients (14.5%). The incidence of PPS after dexamethasone compared with placebo was 13.5% vs 15.5% (relative risk 0.88, 95% CI 0.63-1.22). For complicated PPS, the incidence was 3.8% versus 3.2% (relative risk 1.17, 95% CI 0.57-2.41, P = .66), respectively.\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\nIn patients undergoing valvular cardiac surgery, high-dose dexamethasone treatment had no protective effect on the occurrence of PPS or complicated PPS.','2014','Jul','','2014-06-24 21:19:00',NULL,1,1),(682,1,'nick@masomurray.com','24951538','1755-3245','Cardiovascular research','Expression of fibulin-6 in failing hearts and its role for cardiac fibroblast migration.','Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology. All rights reserved. © The Author 2014. For permissions please email: journals.permissions@oup.com.','\r\nAIMS:\r\nThe cardiac extracellular matrix (ECM) undergoes a dynamic transition following myocardial infarction. Fibulin-6, an ECM protein is expressed in cell junctions particularly in tissues subjected to significant mechanical stress. Fibulin-6 deficiency results in defective cell migration in nematodes and early embryonic lethality in mice. The role of fibulin-6 in healthy and failing myocardium has not been described. We have examined the expression and distribution pattern of fibulin-6 during myocardial remodeling (MR) and detailed its effect on the migratory function of cardiac fibroblasts (CF) in response to TGF-β1.\r\nMETHODS AND RESULTS:\r\nIn healthy murine myocardium fibulin-6 expression is largely confined to larger coronary arteries. It is induced during the early and the late phase of remodeling after infarction in murine hearts predominantly in the scar-muscle junction. Similar results are obtained in human ischemic cardiomyopathy. Fibulin-6 is mostly expressed in close vicinity to vimentin positive cells and is also abundantly expressed in vitro in cultured neonatal CF. TGF-β1 does not induce smooth muscle actin in fibroblasts deficient of fibulin-6, which also compromised their migration. Cells that had migrated expressed more fibulin-6 compared to stationary cells. Plated on fibulin-6 depleted matrix, stress fiber induction in fibroblast in response to TGF-β1 was impaired. In ex vivo explant cultures from postinfarct myocardium, the number of emigrating fibroblasts was also significantly reduced by fibulin-6 siRNA knock down (KD).\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\nFibulin-6, a fibroblast released ECM protein may play an important role during myocardial remodeling by imparting an effect on cardiac fibroblast migration in close and complementary interplay with TGF-β1 signalling.','2014','Jun','20','2014-06-24 21:19:00',NULL,1,1),(683,1,'nick@masomurray.com','24948576','1569-9285','Interactive cardiovascular and thoracic surgery','Computational fluid dynamics of the right ventricular outflow tract and of the pulmonary artery: a bench model of flow dynamics.','© The Author 2014.

The reoperation rate at 5 years can be as high as 25% and depends on age, type of conduit, conduit diameter and principal heart malformation. The aim of this study is to provide a bench model with computer fluid dynamics to analyse the haemodynamics of the RVOT, pulmonary artery, its bifurcation, and left and right pulmonary arteries that in the future may serve as a tool for analysis and prediction of outcome following RVOT reconstruction.\r\nMETHODS:\r\nPressure, flow and diameter at the RVOT, pulmonary artery, bifurcation of the pulmonary artery, and left and right pulmonary arteries were measured in five normal pigs with a mean weight of 24.6 ± 0.89 kg. Data obtained were used for a 3D computer fluid-dynamics simulation of flow conditions, focusing on the pressure, flow and shear stress profile of the pulmonary trunk to the level of the left and right pulmonary arteries.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nThree inlet steady flow profiles were obtained at 0.2, 0.29 and 0.36 m/s that correspond to the flow rates of 1.5, 2.0 and 2.5 l/min flow at the RVOT. The flow velocity profile was constant at the RVOT down to the bifurcation and decreased at the left and right pulmonary arteries. In all three inlet velocity profiles, low sheer stress and low-velocity areas were detected along the left wall of the pulmonary artery, at the pulmonary artery bifurcation and at the ostia of both pulmonary arteries.\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\nThis computed fluid real-time model provides us with a realistic picture of fluid dynamics in the pulmonary tract area. Deep shear stress areas correspond to a turbulent flow profile that is a predictive factor for the development of vessel wall arteriosclerosis. We believe that this bench model may be a useful tool for further evaluation of RVOT pathology following surgical reconstructions.','2014','Jun','19','2014-06-24 21:19:00',NULL,1,1),(684,1,'nick@masomurray.com','24937347','1526-7598','Anesthesia and analgesia','The Long-Term Impact of Early Cardiovascular Therapy Intensification for Postoperative Troponin Elevation after Major Vascular Surgery.','','\r\nBACKGROUND::\r\nAcute cardiac events are a frequent cause of morbidity after vascular surgery. The impact of early evidence-based treatment for patients with an acute cardiac event after vascular surgery on long-term postoperative outcomes has not been extensively studied. We hypothesized that providing appropriate evidence-based treatment to patients with elevated postoperative cardiac troponin levels may limit long-term mortality.\r\nMETHODS::\r\nWe conducted a study of 667 consecutive major vascular surgery patients with an elevated postoperative troponin I level. We then determined which of these patients received medical therapy as per the 2007 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association recommendations for the medical management of patients with chronic stable angina. All patients with troponin elevation were then matched with 2 control patients without postoperative troponin elevation. Matching was done using logistic regression and nearest-neighbor matching methods. The primary study end point was 12 months survival without a major cardiac event (i.e., death, myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, or pulmonary edema requiring hospitalization).\r\nRESULTS::\r\nTherapy was intensified in 43 of 66 patients (65%) who suffered a troponin I elevation after surgery.

The type of procedure, perioperative antiplatelet therapy, and other patient-related factors influence the risk of postoperative haemorrhage. Our objective was to analyze the postoperative risk factors for hemorrhagic complications and to determine the impact of antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy strategies on postoperative bleeding risk in patients with coronary stents undergoing non-cardiac surgery.\r\nPATIENTS AND METHODS:\r\nProspective, multicentre observational cohort study of 1134 consecutive patients with coronary stents undergoing non-cardiac surgery between April 2007 and April 2009. The primary outcome measure was the occurrence of an hemorrhagic complication during the first 30days following the surgery or intervention.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nAmong the 1134 patients evaluated, 108 (9.5%) experienced a postoperative hemorrhagic complication (with a median time to occurrence of 5.3days). These complications were considered major, involved the operative site, and required reoperation in 92 (85.2%), 92 (85.2%), and 20 (18.5%) of patients, respectively. Mortality in patients with a haemorrhagic complication was 12% (n=13). Independent postoperative factors associated with haemorrhagic complications were identified as a high and intermediate bleeding risk procedure and the use and dose of anticoagulants.

Significant systemic arterial hypotension occurred in 14 individuals (26%) and oxygen desaturation in 9 (17%) patients. Administration of an intravenous (IV) vasopressor agent during induction significantly decreased the incidence of hypotension. The type of IV induction agent did not influence hemodynamic alterations, though patients who received propofol experienced a trend towards increased hypotension (83% of pts) when a vasopressor was not used. Inhalational induction, regardless of vasopressor use, was more likely to result in hypotension (60% of pts). The 30-day mortality was 3.8% (two pts). Both patients had minor elective procedures with monitored anesthesia care (MAC).\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\nHypotension is more common in patients with Eisenmenger syndrome and similar physiology when a vasopressor is not used during the peri-induction period, regardless of induction agent. Etomidate tended to have better hemodynamic stability than other induction agents. The use of a vasopressor is recommended. We present general recommendations for anesthesiologists and strongly recommend use of a vasopressor before or during induction to reduce hypotension along with complete avoidance of inhalational induction.

However, the incremental effectiveness, if any, of β-blocker usage in blunting heart rate responsiveness for vascular surgery patients who avoid general anesthesia remains unknown.\r\nMETHODS:\r\nWe reviewed an existing database and identified 213 consecutive vascular surgery cases from 2005-2011 conducted without general anesthesia (i.e., under monitored anesthesia care or regional anesthesia) at a tertiary care Veterans Administration medical center and categorized patients based on presence or absence of preoperative β-blocker prescription. For this series of patients, with the primary outcome of maximum heart rate during the interval between operating room entry to surgical incision, we examined the association of maximal heart rate and preoperative β-blocker usage by performing crude and multivariate linear regression, adjusting for relevant patient factors.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nOf 213 eligible cases, 137 were prescribed preoperative β-blockers, and 76 were not.

If patient is suffering from diabetes, the incidence of cognitive dysfunction greatly increased. We therefore aimed to investigate the effects of isoflurane anesthesia on cognitive dysfunction in a diabetic rat model induced by a single injection of streptozotocin (STZ).

Simple rotation of the catheter, echocardiography-guided placement to the centre of the ventricle, or ventricular expansion through crystalloid infusion may correct for these artifacts. Fluid administration, however, alters left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and volume and therefore stroke volume, thereby obscuring continuous real-time haemodynamic measurements.\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\nPressure-volume artifacts during inotropic infusion are caused by physical contact of the catheter with endocardium.

Myocardial infarction and stroke have been detected essentially in the early phase of the disease, i.e. within 48 hours from hospital admission, with an incidence ranging from as low as 1% to as high as 11%. Age, previous cardiovascular events and high pneumonia severity index were independent predictors of myocardial infarction; clinical predictors of stroke were not identified.

However, treatment programs for chronic pain typically take a rehabilitative approach, emphasizing decreasing pain-related disability first with the expectation that pain reduction will follow. This information is routinely provided to patients yet no studies have systematically examined the actual trajectories of pain and disability in a clinical care setting. In this study of youth with chronic pain (N=94, 8-18 years), it was hypothesized that 1) functional disability and pain would decrease over the course of psychological treatment for chronic pain and 2) functional disability would decrease more quickly than pain intensity. Participants received cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for pain management (M = 5.6 sessions) plus standard medical care. The Functional Disability Inventory and a Numeric Rating Scale of average pain intensity were completed by the child at every CBT session. Hierarchical linear modeling was conducted to examine the longitudinal trajectories of disability and pain. Standardized estimates of the slopes of change were obtained to test differences in rates of change between pain and disability. Results showed an overall significant decline in functional disability over time. While pain scores reduced slightly from pre- to post-treatment, the longitudinal decline over treatment was not statistically significant.

All rights reserved.','\r\nAIM OF THE STUDY:\r\nMast cell (MC) degranulation contributes to the protection mediated by ischemic preconditioning (IPC); however, the precise mechanisms underlying this protection remain largely unknown. Mast cell carboxypeptidase A (MC-CPA) is released solely from MCs and plays a critical role in degrading toxins and endothelin 1 (ET-1). The present study sought to explore whether MC-CPA is involved in the process of IPC in a rodent model of small intestinal ischemia reperfusion (IIR) injury.\r\nMATERIALS AND METHODS:\r\nIIR injuries were induced in Sprague-Dawley rats by clamping the superior mesenteric artery for 60 min followed by reperfusion for 2 h. One cycle of 10 min intestinal ischemia and 10 min of reperfusion was used in the IPC group, and the MC stabilizer cromolyn sodium and MC potato carboxypeptidase inhibitor were administered before the start of IPC. At the end of experiment, intestine tissue was obtained for assays of the MC-CPA3, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, and ET-1 contents and myeloperoxidase activities. Intestinal histologic injury scores and MC degranulation were assessed. Apoptosis indices and cleaved caspase- 3 protein expressions were quantified.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nIIR resulted in severe injury, as evidenced by significant increases in injury scores and MC-CPA3, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, and ET-1 contents that were accompanied with concomitant elevations in cleaved caspase 3 expression, apoptosis indices, and myeloperoxidase activities. IPC induced a significant increase in MC-CPA3, induced MC degranulation, and attenuated IIR injury by downregulating IIR-induced biochemical changes, whereas cromolyn sodium and potato carboxypeptidase inhibitor abolished the IPC-mediated changes.\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\nThese data suggest that IPC protected against IIR injury via the MC degranulation-mediated release of MC-CPA.','2014','May','23','2014-06-24 21:19:04',NULL,1,1),(720,2,'nickm@masomurray.com','24953890','1523-6838','American journal of kidney diseases : the official journal of the National Kidney Foundation','Serum Bicarbonate Concentrations and Kidney Disease Progression in Community-Living Elders: The Health, Aging, and Body Composition (Health ABC) Study.','Published by Elsevier Inc.','\r\nBACKGROUND:\r\nIn populations with prevalent chronic kidney disease (CKD), lower serum bicarbonate levels are associated with more rapid CKD progression, but whether lower bicarbonate levels also are associated with risk of incident estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)\r\nSTUDY DESIGN:\r\nLongitudinal observational cohort study.\r\nSETTING & PARTICIPANTS:\r\nWell-functioning community-living elders aged 70-79 years at inception.\r\nPREDICTOR:\r\nSerum bicarbonate level measured at the time of collection by arterialized venous blood sample using an arterial blood gas analyzer.\r\nOUTCOMES:\r\nChange in eGFR over 7 years, and new eGFR\r\nMEASUREMENTS:\r\nLinear and logistic regressions were used to evaluate associations of baseline serum bicarbonate level with change in eGFR and incident eGFR\r\nRESULTS:\r\nAt baseline, mean eGFR was 84±16 (SD)mL/min/1.73m(2), and serum bicarbonate level was 25.2±1.9mmol/L.

The in vivo role of FoxO1 in the regulation of cardiac NaV1.5 expression remains unknown. The present study aimed to define the role of FoxO1 in the regulation of NaV1.5 expression and cardiac Na(+) channel activity in mouse ventricular cardiomyocytes and assess the cardiac electrophysiological phenotype of mice with cardiac FoxO1 deletion. Tamoxifen-induced and cardiac-specific FoxO1 deletion was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Cardiac FoxO1 deletion failed to result in either cardiac functional changes or hypertrophy as assessed by echocardiography and individual ventricular cell capacitances, respectively. Western blotting showed that FoxO1 was significantly decreased while NaV1.5 protein level was significantly increased in mouse hearts with FoxO1 deletion. Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) revealed that FoxO1 deletion led to an increase in NaV1.5 and Na(+) channel subunit β3 mRNA, but not β1, 2, 4, or connexin 43. Whole patch-clamp recordings demonstrated that cardiac Na(+) currents were significantly augmented by FoxO1 deletion without affecting the steady-state activation and inactivation, leading to accelerated depolarization of action potentials in mouse ventricular cardiomyocytes. Electrocardiogram recordings showed that the QRS complex was significantly shortened and P wave amplitude was significantly increased in conscious and unrestrained mice with cardiac FoxO1 deletion. NaV1.5 expression was decreased in the peri-infarct (border-zone) of mice with myocardial infarction and FoxO1 accumulated in the cardiomyocyte nuclei of chronic ischemic human hearts. Our findings indicate that FoxO1 plays an important role in the regulation of NaV1.5 and β3 subunit expression as well as Na(+) channel activity in the heart and that FoxO1 is involved in the modulation of NaV1.5 expression in ischemic heart disease.','2014','Jun','20','2014-06-24 21:19:07',NULL,1,1),(722,3,'blindmurray@gmail.com','24955355','2314-6141','BioMed research international','Recombinant Human Factor IX Produced from Transgenic Porcine Milk.','','Production of biopharmaceuticals from transgenic animal milk is a cost-effective method for highly complex proteins that cannot be efficiently produced using conventional systems such as microorganisms or animal cells.

The purpose of this work was to test the possibility that the facilitation of lordosis behavior in estrogen-primed rats by progesterone (P) and its 5α- and 5β-reduced metabolites, gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH), leptin, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and vagino-cervical stimulation (VCS) involves interactions with classical ERs by using the selective ER modulator, tamoxifen. To further assess the role of ERs, we also explored the effects of the pure ER antagonist, ICI182780 (ICI), on estrous behavior induced by P and GnRH. Ovariectomized, estrogen-primed rats (5 μg estradiol benzoate 40 hr earlier) were injected intraventricularly with the above-mentioned compounds, or they received VCS. All compounds and VCS effectively facilitated estrous behavior when tested at 60, 120 or 240 min after infusion or application of VCS. Intraventricular infusion of tamoxifen (5 μg), 30 min prior, significantly attenuated estrous behaviors induced in estradiol-primed rats by P, most of its 5α- and 5β-reduced metabolites, GnRH, and PGE2, but not by VCS. Although there was a trend for reduction, tamoxifen did not significantly decrease lordosis in females treated with 5β-pregnan-3,20-dione.

However, treatment programs for chronic pain typically take a rehabilitative approach, emphasizing decreasing pain-related disability first with the expectation that pain reduction will follow. This information is routinely provided to patients yet no studies have systematically examined the actual trajectories of pain and disability in a clinical care setting. In this study of youth with chronic pain (N=94, 8-18 years), it was hypothesized that 1) functional disability and pain would decrease over the course of psychological treatment for chronic pain and 2) functional disability would decrease more quickly than pain intensity. Participants received cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for pain management (M = 5.6 sessions) plus standard medical care. The Functional Disability Inventory and a Numeric Rating Scale of average pain intensity were completed by the child at every CBT session. Hierarchical linear modeling was conducted to examine the longitudinal trajectories of disability and pain. Standardized estimates of the slopes of change were obtained to test differences in rates of change between pain and disability. Results showed an overall significant decline in functional disability over time. While pain scores reduced slightly from pre- to post-treatment, the longitudinal decline over treatment was not statistically significant. As expected, the rate of change of disability was significantly more rapid than pain. Evidence for variability in treatment response was noted suggesting the need for additional research into individual trajectories of change in pediatric pain treatment.','2014','Jun','19','2014-06-24 21:19:07',NULL,1,1),(727,3,'blindmurray@gmail.com','24953887','1528-8447','The journal of pain : official journal of the American Pain Society','The economic costs of chronic pain among a cohort of treatment seeking adolescents in the United States.','Copyright © 2014 American Pain Society.

RBC recovery and availability and plasma elimination were calculated from the Hct, free hemoglobin, and total protein.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nThe main impediment to recovery and availability was the first filling. There, RBC recovery was significantly reduced, while it subsequently varied between 93 and 98%. To produce the first 30 mL of RBCs, ELECTA required 42 mL and C.A.T.S and OrthoPAT 62 mL owing to the dead space of the separation chamber or reservoir, respectively. RBC availability was much higher in subsequent processes, with only minimal differences between the three devices. They all consistently provided high plasma elimination rates.\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\nThe continuous system showed no advantage over a small Latham bowl.

All perforations were located on the anterior surface of the first part of the duodenum and repaired with primary suturing and Graham patch omentoplasty. The recovery was uneventful in all patients. In five patients, urea breath tests were performed postoperatively for Helicobacter Pylori, and the results were positive. All patients underwent triple therapy with lansoprazole, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin. The mean follow-up time was 58 (range 3-94) months. Conclusions : Peptic ulcer perforation should be suspected in children who have acute abdominal pain and peritoneal signs, especially when their suffering is intense. The simple patch repair and postoperative triple therapy for Helicobacter Pylori are safe and satisfactory for treating peptic ulcer perforation in children.','2014','May','','2014-06-24 21:19:07',NULL,1,1),(738,3,'blindmurray@gmail.com','24947930','1078-0432','Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research','Acquired resistance to endocrine treatments is associated to tumor-specific molecular changes in patient-derived luminal breast cancer xenografts.','Copyright © 2014, American Association for Cancer Research.','Purpose: patients with luminal breast cancer (LBC) often become endocrine-resistant over time. We investigated the molecular changes associated with acquired hormono-resistances in patient-derived xenografts of LBC. Experimental design: Two LBC xenografts (HBCx22 and HBCx34) were treated with different endocrine therapies (ET) to obtain xenografts with acquired resistances to tamoxifen (TamR) and ovariectomy (OvaR). PI3K pathway activation was analyzed by western blot and immunohistochemistry and responses to ET combined to everolimus were investigated in vivo. Gene expression analyses were performed by RT-PCR and Affymetrix arrays. Results: HBCx22 TamR xenograft was cross-resistant to several hormono-therapies, while HBCx22 OvaR and HBCx34 TamR exhibited a treatment specific resistance profile. PI3K pathway was similarly activated in parental and resistant xenografts but the addition of everolimus didn\'t restore the response to tamoxifen in TamR xenografts. By contrast, the combination of fulvestrant and everolimus induced tumor regression in vivo in HBCx34 TamR, where we found a cross-talk between ER and PI3K pathways. Expression of several ER-controlled genes and ER co-regulators was significantly changed in both TamR and OvaR tumors, indicating impaired ER transcriptional activity. Expression changes associated with hormono-resistance were both tumor and treatment specific and were enriched for genes involved in cell growth, cell death and cell survival. Conclusions: PDX models of LBC with acquired resistance to endocrine therapies show a great diversity of resistance phenotype, associated to specific deregulations of ER-mediated gene transcription. These models offer a tool for developing anticancer therapies and to investigate the dynamics of resistance emerging during pharmacological interventions.','2014','Jun','19','2014-06-24 21:19:07',NULL,1,1),(739,3,'blindmurray@gmail.com','24947863','1439-0531','Reproduction in domestic animals = Zuchthygiene','Causes, diagnosis and therapy of common diseases in neonatal puppies in the first days of life: cornerstones of practical approach.','© 2014 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.','Neonatal diseases and losses are a common and often unavoidable problem within breeding kennels. Altogether, morbidity and mortality ranges, according to the literature, from 5 to 35%. Among non-infectious causes besides hypoxia during birth, hypothermia, hypoglycaemia and dehydration are mostly responsible for puppy diseases and losses. Approximately 90% of all deaths in hypoxaemic pups occur during the first 2 days. Of 183 pups with hypoxia, 63 died, 92.7% of them within 48 h after birth. Among infectious causes, bacterial infection is the most common cause of neonatal mortality. Escherichia coli, streptococci, staphylococci, Pseudomonas sp., Klebsiella sp., Enterobacter sp. and some other micro-organisms are regularly involved in neonatal infections. Post-mortem findings especially document E. coli, Staphylococcus sp. and Streptococcus sp. as responsible bacteria. The dam and the environment are suspected as sources of neonatal infections as it was shown by genetic relatedness of responsible bacterial strains isolated in both puppies and their dams. From a total of 517 puppies with bacterial infections, the treatment results documented that parenteral administration of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid in 308 neonates showed the best result. Diagnosis of diseases is often made difficult by the absence of variability in clinical signs contrary to adult dogs. Findings during a physical examination in pups differ from those in adults. Furthermore, treatment recommendations have to meet the special conditions in neonates concerning drug metabolism and excretion.','2014','Jun','','2014-06-24 21:19:07',NULL,1,1),(740,3,'blindmurray@gmail.com','24947736','1471-2431','BMC pediatrics','Haemophilus influenzae type b as an important cause of culture-positive acute otitis media in young children in Thailand: a tympanocentesis-based, multi-center, cross-sectional study.','','\r\nBACKGROUND:\r\nStreptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) and Haemophilus influenzae (H. influenzae) are considered major causes of bacterial acute otitis media (AOM) worldwide, but data from Asia on primary causes of AOM are limited.

The pathophysiology remains unclear, although evidence exists that surgical trauma and the use of cardiopulmonary bypass provoke an immune response leading to PPS. We hypothesized that an intraoperative dose of dexamethasone decreases the risk of PPS, by reducing this inflammatory response.\r\nMETHODS:\r\nWe performed a subanalysis of the DECS study, which is a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial of 4,494 patients undergoing cardiac surgery with use of cardiopulmonary bypass. The aim of the DECS study was to investigate whether a single intraoperative dose of 1 mg/kg dexamethasone reduced the incidence of a composite of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, renal failure, or respiratory failure, within 30 days of randomization. In this substudy, we retrospectively analyzed the occurrence of PPS in 822 patients who were included in the DECS trial and underwent valvular surgery. Postpericardiotomy syndrome was diagnosed if 2 of 5 listed symptoms were present: unexplained fever, pleuritic chest pain, pericardial or pleural rub, new or worsening pericardial or pleural effusion. All medical charts, x-rays, and echocardiograms were reviewed. Secondary end point was the occurrence of complicated PPS, defined as PPS with need for evacuation of pleural effusion, pericardiocentesis, and tamponade requiring intervention or hospital readmission for PPS. This is a blinded, single-center, post hoc analysis.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nPostpericardiotomy syndrome occurred in 119 patients (14.5%). The incidence of PPS after dexamethasone compared with placebo was 13.5% vs 15.5% (relative risk 0.88, 95% CI 0.63-1.22). For complicated PPS, the incidence was 3.8% versus 3.2% (relative risk 1.17, 95% CI 0.57-2.41, P = .66), respectively.\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\nIn patients undergoing valvular cardiac surgery, high-dose dexamethasone treatment had no protective effect on the occurrence of PPS or complicated PPS.','2014','Jul','','2014-06-24 21:22:44',NULL,1,1),(742,1,'nick@masomurray.com','24951538','1755-3245','Cardiovascular research','Expression of fibulin-6 in failing hearts and its role for cardiac fibroblast migration.','Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology.

For permissions please email: journals.permissions@oup.com.','\r\nAIMS:\r\nThe cardiac extracellular matrix (ECM) undergoes a dynamic transition following myocardial infarction. Fibulin-6, an ECM protein is expressed in cell junctions particularly in tissues subjected to significant mechanical stress. Fibulin-6 deficiency results in defective cell migration in nematodes and early embryonic lethality in mice. The role of fibulin-6 in healthy and failing myocardium has not been described. We have examined the expression and distribution pattern of fibulin-6 during myocardial remodeling (MR) and detailed its effect on the migratory function of cardiac fibroblasts (CF) in response to TGF-β1.\r\nMETHODS AND RESULTS:\r\nIn healthy murine myocardium fibulin-6 expression is largely confined to larger coronary arteries. It is induced during the early and the late phase of remodeling after infarction in murine hearts predominantly in the scar-muscle junction. Similar results are obtained in human ischemic cardiomyopathy. Fibulin-6 is mostly expressed in close vicinity to vimentin positive cells and is also abundantly expressed in vitro in cultured neonatal CF. TGF-β1 does not induce smooth muscle actin in fibroblasts deficient of fibulin-6, which also compromised their migration. Cells that had migrated expressed more fibulin-6 compared to stationary cells. Plated on fibulin-6 depleted matrix, stress fiber induction in fibroblast in response to TGF-β1 was impaired. In ex vivo explant cultures from postinfarct myocardium, the number of emigrating fibroblasts was also significantly reduced by fibulin-6 siRNA knock down (KD).\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\nFibulin-6, a fibroblast released ECM protein may play an important role during myocardial remodeling by imparting an effect on cardiac fibroblast migration in close and complementary interplay with TGF-β1 signalling.','2014','Jun','20','2014-06-24 21:22:44',NULL,1,1),(743,1,'nick@masomurray.com','24948576','1569-9285','Interactive cardiovascular and thoracic surgery','Computational fluid dynamics of the right ventricular outflow tract and of the pulmonary artery: a bench model of flow dynamics.','© The Author 2014.

The reoperation rate at 5 years can be as high as 25% and depends on age, type of conduit, conduit diameter and principal heart malformation. The aim of this study is to provide a bench model with computer fluid dynamics to analyse the haemodynamics of the RVOT, pulmonary artery, its bifurcation, and left and right pulmonary arteries that in the future may serve as a tool for analysis and prediction of outcome following RVOT reconstruction.\r\nMETHODS:\r\nPressure, flow and diameter at the RVOT, pulmonary artery, bifurcation of the pulmonary artery, and left and right pulmonary arteries were measured in five normal pigs with a mean weight of 24.6 ± 0.89 kg. Data obtained were used for a 3D computer fluid-dynamics simulation of flow conditions, focusing on the pressure, flow and shear stress profile of the pulmonary trunk to the level of the left and right pulmonary arteries.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nThree inlet steady flow profiles were obtained at 0.2, 0.29 and 0.36 m/s that correspond to the flow rates of 1.5, 2.0 and 2.5 l/min flow at the RVOT. The flow velocity profile was constant at the RVOT down to the bifurcation and decreased at the left and right pulmonary arteries. In all three inlet velocity profiles, low sheer stress and low-velocity areas were detected along the left wall of the pulmonary artery, at the pulmonary artery bifurcation and at the ostia of both pulmonary arteries.\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\nThis computed fluid real-time model provides us with a realistic picture of fluid dynamics in the pulmonary tract area. Deep shear stress areas correspond to a turbulent flow profile that is a predictive factor for the development of vessel wall arteriosclerosis. We believe that this bench model may be a useful tool for further evaluation of RVOT pathology following surgical reconstructions.','2014','Jun','19','2014-06-24 21:22:44',NULL,1,1),(744,1,'nick@masomurray.com','24937347','1526-7598','Anesthesia and analgesia','The Long-Term Impact of Early Cardiovascular Therapy Intensification for Postoperative Troponin Elevation after Major Vascular Surgery.','','\r\nBACKGROUND::\r\nAcute cardiac events are a frequent cause of morbidity after vascular surgery. The impact of early evidence-based treatment for patients with an acute cardiac event after vascular surgery on long-term postoperative outcomes has not been extensively studied.

We then determined which of these patients received medical therapy as per the 2007 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association recommendations for the medical management of patients with chronic stable angina. All patients with troponin elevation were then matched with 2 control patients without postoperative troponin elevation. Matching was done using logistic regression and nearest-neighbor matching methods. The primary study end point was 12 months survival without a major cardiac event (i.e., death, myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, or pulmonary edema requiring hospitalization).\r\nRESULTS::\r\nTherapy was intensified in 43 of 66 patients (65%) who suffered a troponin I elevation after surgery.

The type of procedure, perioperative antiplatelet therapy, and other patient-related factors influence the risk of postoperative haemorrhage. Our objective was to analyze the postoperative risk factors for hemorrhagic complications and to determine the impact of antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy strategies on postoperative bleeding risk in patients with coronary stents undergoing non-cardiac surgery.\r\nPATIENTS AND METHODS:\r\nProspective, multicentre observational cohort study of 1134 consecutive patients with coronary stents undergoing non-cardiac surgery between April 2007 and April 2009.

Mortality in patients with a haemorrhagic complication was 12% (n=13). Independent postoperative factors associated with haemorrhagic complications were identified as a high and intermediate bleeding risk procedure and the use and dose of anticoagulants.

Significant systemic arterial hypotension occurred in 14 individuals (26%) and oxygen desaturation in 9 (17%) patients. Administration of an intravenous (IV) vasopressor agent during induction significantly decreased the incidence of hypotension. The type of IV induction agent did not influence hemodynamic alterations, though patients who received propofol experienced a trend towards increased hypotension (83% of pts) when a vasopressor was not used. Inhalational induction, regardless of vasopressor use, was more likely to result in hypotension (60% of pts). The 30-day mortality was 3.8% (two pts). Both patients had minor elective procedures with monitored anesthesia care (MAC).\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\nHypotension is more common in patients with Eisenmenger syndrome and similar physiology when a vasopressor is not used during the peri-induction period, regardless of induction agent. Etomidate tended to have better hemodynamic stability than other induction agents. The use of a vasopressor is recommended. We present general recommendations for anesthesiologists and strongly recommend use of a vasopressor before or during induction to reduce hypotension along with complete avoidance of inhalational induction.

However, the incremental effectiveness, if any, of β-blocker usage in blunting heart rate responsiveness for vascular surgery patients who avoid general anesthesia remains unknown.\r\nMETHODS:\r\nWe reviewed an existing database and identified 213 consecutive vascular surgery cases from 2005-2011 conducted without general anesthesia (i.e., under monitored anesthesia care or regional anesthesia) at a tertiary care Veterans Administration medical center and categorized patients based on presence or absence of preoperative β-blocker prescription. For this series of patients, with the primary outcome of maximum heart rate during the interval between operating room entry to surgical incision, we examined the association of maximal heart rate and preoperative β-blocker usage by performing crude and multivariate linear regression, adjusting for relevant patient factors.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nOf 213 eligible cases, 137 were prescribed preoperative β-blockers, and 76 were not.

One approach for confirming donor identity from DNA samples is the use of multiplexed fluorescent PCR for detecting Short Tandem Repeat (STR) allelic-size polymorphisms for a set of common autosomal loci. While donor identity of DNA extracted directly from blood collected in standard tubes containing anticoagulants can be easily verified by generating STR profiles, RNA from blood collected in PAXgene Blood RNA tubes (PAXgene RNA tubes) is depleted of DNA and is not amenable to STR fingerprinting for donor identity verification. We investigated the feasibility of isolating DNA directly from blood collected in PAXgene RNA tubes for use as template for STR DNA fingerprinting for blood donor identity verification. We determined that DNA extraction can be performed manually with the QIAamp DNA Blood Minikit or on the QIAxtractor instrument with minimal pre-processing protocol additions, and that DNA isolated from blood collected in PAXgene RNA tubes is of sufficient quantity and quality for successful STR fingerprint analysis.

If patient is suffering from diabetes, the incidence of cognitive dysfunction greatly increased. We therefore aimed to investigate the effects of isoflurane anesthesia on cognitive dysfunction in a diabetic rat model induced by a single injection of streptozotocin (STZ). Wistar rats received 2 h of 2% isoflurane or oxygen exposure 1 month after a single intraperitoneal injection of 60 mg/kg of STZ or the vehicle.

Simple rotation of the catheter, echocardiography-guided placement to the centre of the ventricle, or ventricular expansion through crystalloid infusion may correct for these artifacts. Fluid administration, however, alters left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and volume and therefore stroke volume, thereby obscuring continuous real-time haemodynamic measurements.\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\nPressure-volume artifacts during inotropic infusion are caused by physical contact of the catheter with endocardium.

Epidemiological studies have shown that respiratory tract infections are associated with an increased risk of thrombotic-related vascular disease such as myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke and venous thrombosis. Myocardial infarction and stroke have been detected essentially in the early phase of the disease, i.e. within 48 hours from hospital admission, with an incidence ranging from as low as 1% to as high as 11%. Age, previous cardiovascular events and high pneumonia severity index were independent predictors of myocardial infarction; clinical predictors of stroke were not identified. Deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism may also occur after pneumonia but incidence and clinical predictors must be defined. Biological plausibility of such association may be deduced by experimental and clinical studies, showing that lung infection is complicated by platelet aggregation and clotting system activation, as documented by up-regulation of Tissue Factor and down-regulation of activated Protein C. The effect of antithrombotic drugs have been examined in experimental and clinical studies but results are still inconclusive.

However, treatment programs for chronic pain typically take a rehabilitative approach, emphasizing decreasing pain-related disability first with the expectation that pain reduction will follow. This information is routinely provided to patients yet no studies have systematically examined the actual trajectories of pain and disability in a clinical care setting. In this study of youth with chronic pain (N=94, 8-18 years), it was hypothesized that 1) functional disability and pain would decrease over the course of psychological treatment for chronic pain and 2) functional disability would decrease more quickly than pain intensity. Participants received cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for pain management (M = 5.6 sessions) plus standard medical care. The Functional Disability Inventory and a Numeric Rating Scale of average pain intensity were completed by the child at every CBT session. Hierarchical linear modeling was conducted to examine the longitudinal trajectories of disability and pain. Standardized estimates of the slopes of change were obtained to test differences in rates of change between pain and disability. Results showed an overall significant decline in functional disability over time. While pain scores reduced slightly from pre- to post-treatment, the longitudinal decline over treatment was not statistically significant.

However, there is no study investigating the effects of high-voltage PRFT on TN. The aim of this prospective, randomized, double-blinded study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of high-voltage PRFT in comparison with standard-voltage PRFT for idiopathic TN. Sixty severe TN patients were randomly assigned to 2 groups treated with CT-guided standard- or high-voltage-pulsed radiofrequency (RF) of Gasserian ganglion, respectively, between January 2012 and July 2012. Numeric Rating Scales (NRS), carbamazepine dose, and side effects were evaluated at day 1, weeks 1 and 2, months 1, 3, and 6, and 1 year postoperative. There were 27 patients in the standard-voltage group and 26 patients in the high-voltage group who completed the 1-year follow-up study. The effective rates in the standard-voltage and high-voltage PRFT groups were 41% and 69%, respectively, at 1, 3, and 6 months postoperative (P = 0.037). The effective rate in the standard-voltage group decreased to 19% at 1-year postoperative, while in the high-voltage group remained at 69% (P = 0.000). No significant side effects were detected in both groups. In conclusion, CT-guided high-voltage PRFT is an effective and safe interventional therapeutic choice for idiopathic TN patients.','2014','Jun','23','2014-06-24 21:22:48',NULL,1,1),(779,2,'nickm@masomurray.com','24953986','1095-8673','The Journal of surgical research','Pivotal role of mast cell carboxypeptidase A in mediating protection against small intestinal ischemia-reperfusion injury in rats after ischemic preconditioning.','Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.','\r\nAIM OF THE STUDY:\r\nMast cell (MC) degranulation contributes to the protection mediated by ischemic preconditioning (IPC); however, the precise mechanisms underlying this protection remain largely unknown. Mast cell carboxypeptidase A (MC-CPA) is released solely from MCs and plays a critical role in degrading toxins and endothelin 1 (ET-1). The present study sought to explore whether MC-CPA is involved in the process of IPC in a rodent model of small intestinal ischemia reperfusion (IIR) injury.\r\nMATERIALS AND METHODS:\r\nIIR injuries were induced in Sprague-Dawley rats by clamping the superior mesenteric artery for 60 min followed by reperfusion for 2 h. One cycle of 10 min intestinal ischemia and 10 min of reperfusion was used in the IPC group, and the MC stabilizer cromolyn sodium and MC potato carboxypeptidase inhibitor were administered before the start of IPC. At the end of experiment, intestine tissue was obtained for assays of the MC-CPA3, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, and ET-1 contents and myeloperoxidase activities. Intestinal histologic injury scores and MC degranulation were assessed. Apoptosis indices and cleaved caspase- 3 protein expressions were quantified.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nIIR resulted in severe injury, as evidenced by significant increases in injury scores and MC-CPA3, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, and ET-1 contents that were accompanied with concomitant elevations in cleaved caspase 3 expression, apoptosis indices, and myeloperoxidase activities. IPC induced a significant increase in MC-CPA3, induced MC degranulation, and attenuated IIR injury by downregulating IIR-induced biochemical changes, whereas cromolyn sodium and potato carboxypeptidase inhibitor abolished the IPC-mediated changes.\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\nThese data suggest that IPC protected against IIR injury via the MC degranulation-mediated release of MC-CPA.','2014','May','23','2014-06-24 21:22:48',NULL,1,1),(780,2,'nickm@masomurray.com','24953890','1523-6838','American journal of kidney diseases : the official journal of the National Kidney Foundation','Serum Bicarbonate Concentrations and Kidney Disease Progression in Community-Living Elders: The Health, Aging, and Body Composition (Health ABC) Study.','Published by Elsevier Inc.','\r\nBACKGROUND:\r\nIn populations with prevalent chronic kidney disease (CKD), lower serum bicarbonate levels are associated with more rapid CKD progression, but whether lower bicarbonate levels also are associated with risk of incident estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)\r\nSTUDY DESIGN:\r\nLongitudinal observational cohort study.\r\nSETTING & PARTICIPANTS:\r\nWell-functioning community-living elders aged 70-79 years at inception.\r\nPREDICTOR:\r\nSerum bicarbonate level measured at the time of collection by arterialized venous blood sample using an arterial blood gas analyzer.\r\nOUTCOMES:\r\nChange in eGFR over 7 years, and new eGFR\r\nMEASUREMENTS:\r\nLinear and logistic regressions were used to evaluate associations of baseline serum bicarbonate level with change in eGFR and incident eGFR\r\nRESULTS:\r\nAt baseline, mean eGFR was 84±16 (SD)mL/min/1.73m(2), and serum bicarbonate level was 25.2±1.9mmol/L.

The in vivo role of FoxO1 in the regulation of cardiac NaV1.5 expression remains unknown. The present study aimed to define the role of FoxO1 in the regulation of NaV1.5 expression and cardiac Na(+) channel activity in mouse ventricular cardiomyocytes and assess the cardiac electrophysiological phenotype of mice with cardiac FoxO1 deletion. Tamoxifen-induced and cardiac-specific FoxO1 deletion was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Cardiac FoxO1 deletion failed to result in either cardiac functional changes or hypertrophy as assessed by echocardiography and individual ventricular cell capacitances, respectively. Western blotting showed that FoxO1 was significantly decreased while NaV1.5 protein level was significantly increased in mouse hearts with FoxO1 deletion. Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) revealed that FoxO1 deletion led to an increase in NaV1.5 and Na(+) channel subunit β3 mRNA, but not β1, 2, 4, or connexin 43. Whole patch-clamp recordings demonstrated that cardiac Na(+) currents were significantly augmented by FoxO1 deletion without affecting the steady-state activation and inactivation, leading to accelerated depolarization of action potentials in mouse ventricular cardiomyocytes. Electrocardiogram recordings showed that the QRS complex was significantly shortened and P wave amplitude was significantly increased in conscious and unrestrained mice with cardiac FoxO1 deletion. NaV1.5 expression was decreased in the peri-infarct (border-zone) of mice with myocardial infarction and FoxO1 accumulated in the cardiomyocyte nuclei of chronic ischemic human hearts. Our findings indicate that FoxO1 plays an important role in the regulation of NaV1.5 and β3 subunit expression as well as Na(+) channel activity in the heart and that FoxO1 is involved in the modulation of NaV1.5 expression in ischemic heart disease.','2014','Jun','20','2014-06-24 21:22:52',NULL,1,1),(782,3,'blindmurray@gmail.com','24955355','2314-6141','BioMed research international','Recombinant Human Factor IX Produced from Transgenic Porcine Milk.','','Production of biopharmaceuticals from transgenic animal milk is a cost-effective method for highly complex proteins that cannot be efficiently produced using conventional systems such as microorganisms or animal cells.

The purpose of this work was to test the possibility that the facilitation of lordosis behavior in estrogen-primed rats by progesterone (P) and its 5α- and 5β-reduced metabolites, gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH), leptin, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and vagino-cervical stimulation (VCS) involves interactions with classical ERs by using the selective ER modulator, tamoxifen. To further assess the role of ERs, we also explored the effects of the pure ER antagonist, ICI182780 (ICI), on estrous behavior induced by P and GnRH. Ovariectomized, estrogen-primed rats (5 μg estradiol benzoate 40 hr earlier) were injected intraventricularly with the above-mentioned compounds, or they received VCS. All compounds and VCS effectively facilitated estrous behavior when tested at 60, 120 or 240 min after infusion or application of VCS. Intraventricular infusion of tamoxifen (5 μg), 30 min prior, significantly attenuated estrous behaviors induced in estradiol-primed rats by P, most of its 5α- and 5β-reduced metabolites, GnRH, and PGE2, but not by VCS. Although there was a trend for reduction, tamoxifen did not significantly decrease lordosis in females treated with 5β-pregnan-3,20-dione. ICI also inhibited lordosis behavior induced by P and GnRH at some testing intervals.

However, treatment programs for chronic pain typically take a rehabilitative approach, emphasizing decreasing pain-related disability first with the expectation that pain reduction will follow. This information is routinely provided to patients yet no studies have systematically examined the actual trajectories of pain and disability in a clinical care setting. In this study of youth with chronic pain (N=94, 8-18 years), it was hypothesized that 1) functional disability and pain would decrease over the course of psychological treatment for chronic pain and 2) functional disability would decrease more quickly than pain intensity. Participants received cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for pain management (M = 5.6 sessions) plus standard medical care. The Functional Disability Inventory and a Numeric Rating Scale of average pain intensity were completed by the child at every CBT session. Hierarchical linear modeling was conducted to examine the longitudinal trajectories of disability and pain. Standardized estimates of the slopes of change were obtained to test differences in rates of change between pain and disability. Results showed an overall significant decline in functional disability over time. While pain scores reduced slightly from pre- to post-treatment, the longitudinal decline over treatment was not statistically significant. As expected, the rate of change of disability was significantly more rapid than pain.

Twenty-milliliter portions of red blood cells (RBCs) were added and processed under various conditions, including clinically relevant first filling and intermittent emptying. RBC recovery and availability and plasma elimination were calculated from the Hct, free hemoglobin, and total protein.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nThe main impediment to recovery and availability was the first filling. There, RBC recovery was significantly reduced, while it subsequently varied between 93 and 98%. To produce the first 30 mL of RBCs, ELECTA required 42 mL and C.A.T.S and OrthoPAT 62 mL owing to the dead space of the separation chamber or reservoir, respectively. RBC availability was much higher in subsequent processes, with only minimal differences between the three devices. They all consistently provided high plasma elimination rates.\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\nThe continuous system showed no advantage over a small Latham bowl.

Therefore, the diagnosis can be missed until complications such as perforation or hemorrhage occur. Few reports have investigated the procedures and outcomes of children who have undergone operations for perforated duodenal ulcers. We report our experience with the modified Graham technique for perforated duodenal ulcers in nine children and review the literature. Methods : The records of patients operated on for a perforated duodenal ulcer in the last 8 years in two pediatric surgery centers were evaluated retrospectively. Patient demographics, symptoms, time to admission to hospital, operative findings, and postoperative clinical course were evaluated. Results : Nine children (mean age 13.2 years, range 6-170 years) were included. All patients were admitted in the first six hours after their abdominal pain started. In three patients, there was free air on plain x-rays, while the x-rays were normal in six. All perforations were located on the anterior surface of the first part of the duodenum and repaired with primary suturing and Graham patch omentoplasty. The recovery was uneventful in all patients. In five patients, urea breath tests were performed postoperatively for Helicobacter Pylori, and the results were positive. All patients underwent triple therapy with lansoprazole, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin. The mean follow-up time was 58 (range 3-94) months. Conclusions : Peptic ulcer perforation should be suspected in children who have acute abdominal pain and peritoneal signs, especially when their suffering is intense. The simple patch repair and postoperative triple therapy for Helicobacter Pylori are safe and satisfactory for treating peptic ulcer perforation in children.','2014','May','','2014-06-24 21:22:52',NULL,1,1),(798,3,'blindmurray@gmail.com','24947930','1078-0432','Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research','Acquired resistance to endocrine treatments is associated to tumor-specific molecular changes in patient-derived luminal breast cancer xenografts.','Copyright © 2014, American Association for Cancer Research.','Purpose: patients with luminal breast cancer (LBC) often become endocrine-resistant over time. We investigated the molecular changes associated with acquired hormono-resistances in patient-derived xenografts of LBC. Experimental design: Two LBC xenografts (HBCx22 and HBCx34) were treated with different endocrine therapies (ET) to obtain xenografts with acquired resistances to tamoxifen (TamR) and ovariectomy (OvaR). PI3K pathway activation was analyzed by western blot and immunohistochemistry and responses to ET combined to everolimus were investigated in vivo. Gene expression analyses were performed by RT-PCR and Affymetrix arrays. Results: HBCx22 TamR xenograft was cross-resistant to several hormono-therapies, while HBCx22 OvaR and HBCx34 TamR exhibited a treatment specific resistance profile. PI3K pathway was similarly activated in parental and resistant xenografts but the addition of everolimus didn\'t restore the response to tamoxifen in TamR xenografts. By contrast, the combination of fulvestrant and everolimus induced tumor regression in vivo in HBCx34 TamR, where we found a cross-talk between ER and PI3K pathways. Expression of several ER-controlled genes and ER co-regulators was significantly changed in both TamR and OvaR tumors, indicating impaired ER transcriptional activity. Expression changes associated with hormono-resistance were both tumor and treatment specific and were enriched for genes involved in cell growth, cell death and cell survival. Conclusions: PDX models of LBC with acquired resistance to endocrine therapies show a great diversity of resistance phenotype, associated to specific deregulations of ER-mediated gene transcription. These models offer a tool for developing anticancer therapies and to investigate the dynamics of resistance emerging during pharmacological interventions.','2014','Jun','19','2014-06-24 21:22:52',NULL,1,1),(799,3,'blindmurray@gmail.com','24947863','1439-0531','Reproduction in domestic animals = Zuchthygiene','Causes, diagnosis and therapy of common diseases in neonatal puppies in the first days of life: cornerstones of practical approach.','© 2014 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.','Neonatal diseases and losses are a common and often unavoidable problem within breeding kennels. Altogether, morbidity and mortality ranges, according to the literature, from 5 to 35%. Among non-infectious causes besides hypoxia during birth, hypothermia, hypoglycaemia and dehydration are mostly responsible for puppy diseases and losses. Approximately 90% of all deaths in hypoxaemic pups occur during the first 2 days. Of 183 pups with hypoxia, 63 died, 92.7% of them within 48 h after birth. Among infectious causes, bacterial infection is the most common cause of neonatal mortality. Escherichia coli, streptococci, staphylococci, Pseudomonas sp., Klebsiella sp., Enterobacter sp. and some other micro-organisms are regularly involved in neonatal infections. Post-mortem findings especially document E. coli, Staphylococcus sp. and Streptococcus sp. as responsible bacteria. The dam and the environment are suspected as sources of neonatal infections as it was shown by genetic relatedness of responsible bacterial strains isolated in both puppies and their dams. From a total of 517 puppies with bacterial infections, the treatment results documented that parenteral administration of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid in 308 neonates showed the best result. Diagnosis of diseases is often made difficult by the absence of variability in clinical signs contrary to adult dogs. Findings during a physical examination in pups differ from those in adults.

The pathophysiology remains unclear, although evidence exists that surgical trauma and the use of cardiopulmonary bypass provoke an immune response leading to PPS. We hypothesized that an intraoperative dose of dexamethasone decreases the risk of PPS, by reducing this inflammatory response.\r\nMETHODS:\r\nWe performed a subanalysis of the DECS study, which is a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial of 4,494 patients undergoing cardiac surgery with use of cardiopulmonary bypass. The aim of the DECS study was to investigate whether a single intraoperative dose of 1 mg/kg dexamethasone reduced the incidence of a composite of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, renal failure, or respiratory failure, within 30 days of randomization. In this substudy, we retrospectively analyzed the occurrence of PPS in 822 patients who were included in the DECS trial and underwent valvular surgery. Postpericardiotomy syndrome was diagnosed if 2 of 5 listed symptoms were present: unexplained fever, pleuritic chest pain, pericardial or pleural rub, new or worsening pericardial or pleural effusion. All medical charts, x-rays, and echocardiograms were reviewed. Secondary end point was the occurrence of complicated PPS, defined as PPS with need for evacuation of pleural effusion, pericardiocentesis, and tamponade requiring intervention or hospital readmission for PPS. This is a blinded, single-center, post hoc analysis.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nPostpericardiotomy syndrome occurred in 119 patients (14.5%). The incidence of PPS after dexamethasone compared with placebo was 13.5% vs 15.5% (relative risk 0.88, 95% CI 0.63-1.22).

All rights reserved. © The Author 2014. For permissions please email: journals.permissions@oup.com.','\r\nAIMS:\r\nThe cardiac extracellular matrix (ECM) undergoes a dynamic transition following myocardial infarction. Fibulin-6, an ECM protein is expressed in cell junctions particularly in tissues subjected to significant mechanical stress. Fibulin-6 deficiency results in defective cell migration in nematodes and early embryonic lethality in mice. The role of fibulin-6 in healthy and failing myocardium has not been described. We have examined the expression and distribution pattern of fibulin-6 during myocardial remodeling (MR) and detailed its effect on the migratory function of cardiac fibroblasts (CF) in response to TGF-β1.\r\nMETHODS AND RESULTS:\r\nIn healthy murine myocardium fibulin-6 expression is largely confined to larger coronary arteries. It is induced during the early and the late phase of remodeling after infarction in murine hearts predominantly in the scar-muscle junction. Similar results are obtained in human ischemic cardiomyopathy. Fibulin-6 is mostly expressed in close vicinity to vimentin positive cells and is also abundantly expressed in vitro in cultured neonatal CF. TGF-β1 does not induce smooth muscle actin in fibroblasts deficient of fibulin-6, which also compromised their migration. Cells that had migrated expressed more fibulin-6 compared to stationary cells. Plated on fibulin-6 depleted matrix, stress fiber induction in fibroblast in response to TGF-β1 was impaired. In ex vivo explant cultures from postinfarct myocardium, the number of emigrating fibroblasts was also significantly reduced by fibulin-6 siRNA knock down (KD).\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\nFibulin-6, a fibroblast released ECM protein may play an important role during myocardial remodeling by imparting an effect on cardiac fibroblast migration in close and complementary interplay with TGF-β1 signalling.','2014','Jun','20','2014-06-24 21:26:36',NULL,1,1),(803,1,'nick@masomurray.com','24948576','1569-9285','Interactive cardiovascular and thoracic surgery','Computational fluid dynamics of the right ventricular outflow tract and of the pulmonary artery: a bench model of flow dynamics.','© The Author 2014.

The reoperation rate at 5 years can be as high as 25% and depends on age, type of conduit, conduit diameter and principal heart malformation. The aim of this study is to provide a bench model with computer fluid dynamics to analyse the haemodynamics of the RVOT, pulmonary artery, its bifurcation, and left and right pulmonary arteries that in the future may serve as a tool for analysis and prediction of outcome following RVOT reconstruction.\r\nMETHODS:\r\nPressure, flow and diameter at the RVOT, pulmonary artery, bifurcation of the pulmonary artery, and left and right pulmonary arteries were measured in five normal pigs with a mean weight of 24.6 ± 0.89 kg. Data obtained were used for a 3D computer fluid-dynamics simulation of flow conditions, focusing on the pressure, flow and shear stress profile of the pulmonary trunk to the level of the left and right pulmonary arteries.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nThree inlet steady flow profiles were obtained at 0.2, 0.29 and 0.36 m/s that correspond to the flow rates of 1.5, 2.0 and 2.5 l/min flow at the RVOT. The flow velocity profile was constant at the RVOT down to the bifurcation and decreased at the left and right pulmonary arteries. In all three inlet velocity profiles, low sheer stress and low-velocity areas were detected along the left wall of the pulmonary artery, at the pulmonary artery bifurcation and at the ostia of both pulmonary arteries.\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\nThis computed fluid real-time model provides us with a realistic picture of fluid dynamics in the pulmonary tract area. Deep shear stress areas correspond to a turbulent flow profile that is a predictive factor for the development of vessel wall arteriosclerosis.

We then determined which of these patients received medical therapy as per the 2007 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association recommendations for the medical management of patients with chronic stable angina. All patients with troponin elevation were then matched with 2 control patients without postoperative troponin elevation. Matching was done using logistic regression and nearest-neighbor matching methods. The primary study end point was 12 months survival without a major cardiac event (i.e., death, myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, or pulmonary edema requiring hospitalization).\r\nRESULTS::\r\nTherapy was intensified in 43 of 66 patients (65%) who suffered a troponin I elevation after surgery.

The type of procedure, perioperative antiplatelet therapy, and other patient-related factors influence the risk of postoperative haemorrhage. Our objective was to analyze the postoperative risk factors for hemorrhagic complications and to determine the impact of antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy strategies on postoperative bleeding risk in patients with coronary stents undergoing non-cardiac surgery.\r\nPATIENTS AND METHODS:\r\nProspective, multicentre observational cohort study of 1134 consecutive patients with coronary stents undergoing non-cardiac surgery between April 2007 and April 2009.

Mortality in patients with a haemorrhagic complication was 12% (n=13). Independent postoperative factors associated with haemorrhagic complications were identified as a high and intermediate bleeding risk procedure and the use and dose of anticoagulants.

Significant systemic arterial hypotension occurred in 14 individuals (26%) and oxygen desaturation in 9 (17%) patients. Administration of an intravenous (IV) vasopressor agent during induction significantly decreased the incidence of hypotension. The type of IV induction agent did not influence hemodynamic alterations, though patients who received propofol experienced a trend towards increased hypotension (83% of pts) when a vasopressor was not used. Inhalational induction, regardless of vasopressor use, was more likely to result in hypotension (60% of pts). The 30-day mortality was 3.8% (two pts). Both patients had minor elective procedures with monitored anesthesia care (MAC).\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\nHypotension is more common in patients with Eisenmenger syndrome and similar physiology when a vasopressor is not used during the peri-induction period, regardless of induction agent. Etomidate tended to have better hemodynamic stability than other induction agents. The use of a vasopressor is recommended. We present general recommendations for anesthesiologists and strongly recommend use of a vasopressor before or during induction to reduce hypotension along with complete avoidance of inhalational induction.

Handling such a large number of biospecimens presents the challenge of ensuring that samples are not switched or mislabeled during processing. One approach for confirming donor identity from DNA samples is the use of multiplexed fluorescent PCR for detecting Short Tandem Repeat (STR) allelic-size polymorphisms for a set of common autosomal loci. While donor identity of DNA extracted directly from blood collected in standard tubes containing anticoagulants can be easily verified by generating STR profiles, RNA from blood collected in PAXgene Blood RNA tubes (PAXgene RNA tubes) is depleted of DNA and is not amenable to STR fingerprinting for donor identity verification. We investigated the feasibility of isolating DNA directly from blood collected in PAXgene RNA tubes for use as template for STR DNA fingerprinting for blood donor identity verification. We determined that DNA extraction can be performed manually with the QIAamp DNA Blood Minikit or on the QIAxtractor instrument with minimal pre-processing protocol additions, and that DNA isolated from blood collected in PAXgene RNA tubes is of sufficient quantity and quality for successful STR fingerprint analysis.

Additionally, diabetes is also an important pathogenic factor for the emergence of cognitive dysfunction. If patient is suffering from diabetes, the incidence of cognitive dysfunction greatly increased. We therefore aimed to investigate the effects of isoflurane anesthesia on cognitive dysfunction in a diabetic rat model induced by a single injection of streptozotocin (STZ). Wistar rats received 2 h of 2% isoflurane or oxygen exposure 1 month after a single intraperitoneal injection of 60 mg/kg of STZ or the vehicle.

In addition to the expression of amyloid-β (Aβ), superoxide dismutase (SOD), malonyldialdehyde (MDA), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β), isoflurane anesthesia significantly increased as compared with a single injection of STZ. However, isoflurane anesthesia had no effect on the blood glucose and leptin.

Simple rotation of the catheter, echocardiography-guided placement to the centre of the ventricle, or ventricular expansion through crystalloid infusion may correct for these artifacts. Fluid administration, however, alters left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and volume and therefore stroke volume, thereby obscuring continuous real-time haemodynamic measurements.\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\nPressure-volume artifacts during inotropic infusion are caused by physical contact of the catheter with endocardium.

Age, previous cardiovascular events and high pneumonia severity index were independent predictors of myocardial infarction; clinical predictors of stroke were not identified. Deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism may also occur after pneumonia but incidence and clinical predictors must be defined. Biological plausibility of such association may be deduced by experimental and clinical studies, showing that lung infection is complicated by platelet aggregation and clotting system activation, as documented by up-regulation of Tissue Factor and down-regulation of activated Protein C. The effect of antithrombotic drugs have been examined in experimental and clinical studies but results are still inconclusive. Thrombotic-related vascular disease such as myocardial infarction, stroke and venous thrombosis may complicate the clinical course of pneumonia and worsen its prognosis. Further definition of predictors may help to identify patients at higher risk of artery and venous thrombosis. Patients with pneumonia could benefit from antithrombotic strategy including anticoagulants and/or antiplatelet drugs but this should be tested in randomized clinical studies.

Recently, much attention has been paid to the PRFT dose and intra-operative parameters. It has been reported that high-voltage PRFT could significantly reduce discogenic pain. However, there is no study investigating the effects of high-voltage PRFT on TN. The aim of this prospective, randomized, double-blinded study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of high-voltage PRFT in comparison with standard-voltage PRFT for idiopathic TN. Sixty severe TN patients were randomly assigned to 2 groups treated with CT-guided standard- or high-voltage-pulsed radiofrequency (RF) of Gasserian ganglion, respectively, between January 2012 and July 2012. Numeric Rating Scales (NRS), carbamazepine dose, and side effects were evaluated at day 1, weeks 1 and 2, months 1, 3, and 6, and 1 year postoperative. There were 27 patients in the standard-voltage group and 26 patients in the high-voltage group who completed the 1-year follow-up study. The effective rates in the standard-voltage and high-voltage PRFT groups were 41% and 69%, respectively, at 1, 3, and 6 months postoperative (P = 0.037). The effective rate in the standard-voltage group decreased to 19% at 1-year postoperative, while in the high-voltage group remained at 69% (P = 0.000). No significant side effects were detected in both groups. In conclusion, CT-guided high-voltage PRFT is an effective and safe interventional therapeutic choice for idiopathic TN patients.','2014','Jun','23','2014-06-24 21:26:40',NULL,1,1),(839,2,'nickm@masomurray.com','24953986','1095-8673','The Journal of surgical research','Pivotal role of mast cell carboxypeptidase A in mediating protection against small intestinal ischemia-reperfusion injury in rats after ischemic preconditioning.','Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.','\r\nAIM OF THE STUDY:\r\nMast cell (MC) degranulation contributes to the protection mediated by ischemic preconditioning (IPC); however, the precise mechanisms underlying this protection remain largely unknown. Mast cell carboxypeptidase A (MC-CPA) is released solely from MCs and plays a critical role in degrading toxins and endothelin 1 (ET-1). The present study sought to explore whether MC-CPA is involved in the process of IPC in a rodent model of small intestinal ischemia reperfusion (IIR) injury.\r\nMATERIALS AND METHODS:\r\nIIR injuries were induced in Sprague-Dawley rats by clamping the superior mesenteric artery for 60 min followed by reperfusion for 2 h. One cycle of 10 min intestinal ischemia and 10 min of reperfusion was used in the IPC group, and the MC stabilizer cromolyn sodium and MC potato carboxypeptidase inhibitor were administered before the start of IPC. At the end of experiment, intestine tissue was obtained for assays of the MC-CPA3, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, and ET-1 contents and myeloperoxidase activities. Intestinal histologic injury scores and MC degranulation were assessed. Apoptosis indices and cleaved caspase- 3 protein expressions were quantified.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nIIR resulted in severe injury, as evidenced by significant increases in injury scores and MC-CPA3, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, and ET-1 contents that were accompanied with concomitant elevations in cleaved caspase 3 expression, apoptosis indices, and myeloperoxidase activities. IPC induced a significant increase in MC-CPA3, induced MC degranulation, and attenuated IIR injury by downregulating IIR-induced biochemical changes, whereas cromolyn sodium and potato carboxypeptidase inhibitor abolished the IPC-mediated changes.\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\nThese data suggest that IPC protected against IIR injury via the MC degranulation-mediated release of MC-CPA.','2014','May','23','2014-06-24 21:26:40',NULL,1,1),(840,2,'nickm@masomurray.com','24953890','1523-6838','American journal of kidney diseases : the official journal of the National Kidney Foundation','Serum Bicarbonate Concentrations and Kidney Disease Progression in Community-Living Elders: The Health, Aging, and Body Composition (Health ABC) Study.','Published by Elsevier Inc.','\r\nBACKGROUND:\r\nIn populations with prevalent chronic kidney disease (CKD), lower serum bicarbonate levels are associated with more rapid CKD progression, but whether lower bicarbonate levels also are associated with risk of incident estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)\r\nSTUDY DESIGN:\r\nLongitudinal observational cohort study.\r\nSETTING & PARTICIPANTS:\r\nWell-functioning community-living elders aged 70-79 years at inception.\r\nPREDICTOR:\r\nSerum bicarbonate level measured at the time of collection by arterialized venous blood sample using an arterial blood gas analyzer.\r\nOUTCOMES:\r\nChange in eGFR over 7 years, and new eGFR\r\nMEASUREMENTS:\r\nLinear and logistic regressions were used to evaluate associations of baseline serum bicarbonate level with change in eGFR and incident eGFR\r\nRESULTS:\r\nAt baseline, mean eGFR was 84±16 (SD)mL/min/1.73m(2), and serum bicarbonate level was 25.2±1.9mmol/L.

The in vivo role of FoxO1 in the regulation of cardiac NaV1.5 expression remains unknown. The present study aimed to define the role of FoxO1 in the regulation of NaV1.5 expression and cardiac Na(+) channel activity in mouse ventricular cardiomyocytes and assess the cardiac electrophysiological phenotype of mice with cardiac FoxO1 deletion. Tamoxifen-induced and cardiac-specific FoxO1 deletion was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Cardiac FoxO1 deletion failed to result in either cardiac functional changes or hypertrophy as assessed by echocardiography and individual ventricular cell capacitances, respectively. Western blotting showed that FoxO1 was significantly decreased while NaV1.5 protein level was significantly increased in mouse hearts with FoxO1 deletion. Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) revealed that FoxO1 deletion led to an increase in NaV1.5 and Na(+) channel subunit β3 mRNA, but not β1, 2, 4, or connexin 43. Whole patch-clamp recordings demonstrated that cardiac Na(+) currents were significantly augmented by FoxO1 deletion without affecting the steady-state activation and inactivation, leading to accelerated depolarization of action potentials in mouse ventricular cardiomyocytes. Electrocardiogram recordings showed that the QRS complex was significantly shortened and P wave amplitude was significantly increased in conscious and unrestrained mice with cardiac FoxO1 deletion. NaV1.5 expression was decreased in the peri-infarct (border-zone) of mice with myocardial infarction and FoxO1 accumulated in the cardiomyocyte nuclei of chronic ischemic human hearts. Our findings indicate that FoxO1 plays an important role in the regulation of NaV1.5 and β3 subunit expression as well as Na(+) channel activity in the heart and that FoxO1 is involved in the modulation of NaV1.5 expression in ischemic heart disease.','2014','Jun','20','2014-06-24 21:26:43',NULL,1,1),(842,3,'blindmurray@gmail.com','24955355','2314-6141','BioMed research international','Recombinant Human Factor IX Produced from Transgenic Porcine Milk.','','Production of biopharmaceuticals from transgenic animal milk is a cost-effective method for highly complex proteins that cannot be efficiently produced using conventional systems such as microorganisms or animal cells.

The purpose of this work was to test the possibility that the facilitation of lordosis behavior in estrogen-primed rats by progesterone (P) and its 5α- and 5β-reduced metabolites, gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH), leptin, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and vagino-cervical stimulation (VCS) involves interactions with classical ERs by using the selective ER modulator, tamoxifen. To further assess the role of ERs, we also explored the effects of the pure ER antagonist, ICI182780 (ICI), on estrous behavior induced by P and GnRH. Ovariectomized, estrogen-primed rats (5 μg estradiol benzoate 40 hr earlier) were injected intraventricularly with the above-mentioned compounds, or they received VCS. All compounds and VCS effectively facilitated estrous behavior when tested at 60, 120 or 240 min after infusion or application of VCS. Intraventricular infusion of tamoxifen (5 μg), 30 min prior, significantly attenuated estrous behaviors induced in estradiol-primed rats by P, most of its 5α- and 5β-reduced metabolites, GnRH, and PGE2, but not by VCS. Although there was a trend for reduction, tamoxifen did not significantly decrease lordosis in females treated with 5β-pregnan-3,20-dione. ICI also inhibited lordosis behavior induced by P and GnRH at some testing intervals. These results suggest that activation of classical ERs participates in the triggering effects on estrous behavior induced by agents with different chemical structures that do not bind directly to ERs.','2014','Jun','19','2014-06-24 21:26:43',NULL,1,1),(846,3,'blindmurray@gmail.com','24954165','1872-6623','Pain','Differential changes in functional disability and pain intensity over the course of psychological treatment for children with chronic pain.','Copyright © 2014.

There, RBC recovery was significantly reduced, while it subsequently varied between 93 and 98%. To produce the first 30 mL of RBCs, ELECTA required 42 mL and C.A.T.S and OrthoPAT 62 mL owing to the dead space of the separation chamber or reservoir, respectively. RBC availability was much higher in subsequent processes, with only minimal differences between the three devices. They all consistently provided high plasma elimination rates.\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\nThe continuous system showed no advantage over a small Latham bowl.

Human embryonic stem cells are capable of differentiating into any cell type and represent a promising model to study mechanisms governing anesthetic-induced neurotoxicity.\r\nMETHODS::\r\nCell death in human embryonic stem cell-derived neurons was assessed using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate in situ nick end labeling staining, and microRNA expression was assessed using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. miR-21 was overexpressed and knocked down using an miR-21 mimic and antagomir, respectively. Sprouty 2 was knocked down using a small interfering RNA, and the expression of the miR-21 targets of interest was assessed by Western blot.\r\nRESULTS::\r\nPropofol dose and exposure time dependently induced significant cell death (n = 3) in the neurons and down-regulated several microRNAs, including miR-21. Overexpression of miR-21 and knockdown of Sprouty 2 attenuated the increase in terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate in situ nick end labeling-positive cells following propofol exposure. In addition, miR-21 knockdown increased the number of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate in situ nick end labeling-positive cells by 30% (n = 5). Finally, activated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 and protein kinase B (Akt) were down-regulated, and Sprouty 2 was up-regulated following propofol exposure (n = 3).\r\nCONCLUSIONS::\r\nThese data suggest that (1) human embryonic stem cell-derived neurons represent a promising in vitro human model for studying anesthetic-induced neurotoxicity, (2) propofol induces cell death in human embryonic stem cell-derived neurons, and (3) the propofol-induced cell death may occur via a signal transducer and activator of transcription 3/miR-21/Sprouty 2-dependent mechanism.','2014','Jun','19','2014-06-24 21:26:43',NULL,1,1),(855,3,'blindmurray@gmail.com','24949934','1878-5867','Steroids','The evolution of nonsteroidal antiestrogens to become selective estrogen receptor modulators.','Copyright © 2014.

Therefore, the diagnosis can be missed until complications such as perforation or hemorrhage occur. Few reports have investigated the procedures and outcomes of children who have undergone operations for perforated duodenal ulcers. We report our experience with the modified Graham technique for perforated duodenal ulcers in nine children and review the literature. Methods : The records of patients operated on for a perforated duodenal ulcer in the last 8 years in two pediatric surgery centers were evaluated retrospectively. Patient demographics, symptoms, time to admission to hospital, operative findings, and postoperative clinical course were evaluated. Results : Nine children (mean age 13.2 years, range 6-170 years) were included. All patients were admitted in the first six hours after their abdominal pain started. In three patients, there was free air on plain x-rays, while the x-rays were normal in six. All perforations were located on the anterior surface of the first part of the duodenum and repaired with primary suturing and Graham patch omentoplasty. The recovery was uneventful in all patients. In five patients, urea breath tests were performed postoperatively for Helicobacter Pylori, and the results were positive. All patients underwent triple therapy with lansoprazole, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin. The mean follow-up time was 58 (range 3-94) months. Conclusions : Peptic ulcer perforation should be suspected in children who have acute abdominal pain and peritoneal signs, especially when their suffering is intense. The simple patch repair and postoperative triple therapy for Helicobacter Pylori are safe and satisfactory for treating peptic ulcer perforation in children.','2014','May','','2014-06-24 21:26:43',NULL,1,1),(858,3,'blindmurray@gmail.com','24947930','1078-0432','Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research','Acquired resistance to endocrine treatments is associated to tumor-specific molecular changes in patient-derived luminal breast cancer xenografts.','Copyright © 2014, American Association for Cancer Research.','Purpose: patients with luminal breast cancer (LBC) often become endocrine-resistant over time. We investigated the molecular changes associated with acquired hormono-resistances in patient-derived xenografts of LBC. Experimental design: Two LBC xenografts (HBCx22 and HBCx34) were treated with different endocrine therapies (ET) to obtain xenografts with acquired resistances to tamoxifen (TamR) and ovariectomy (OvaR). PI3K pathway activation was analyzed by western blot and immunohistochemistry and responses to ET combined to everolimus were investigated in vivo. Gene expression analyses were performed by RT-PCR and Affymetrix arrays. Results: HBCx22 TamR xenograft was cross-resistant to several hormono-therapies, while HBCx22 OvaR and HBCx34 TamR exhibited a treatment specific resistance profile. PI3K pathway was similarly activated in parental and resistant xenografts but the addition of everolimus didn\'t restore the response to tamoxifen in TamR xenografts. By contrast, the combination of fulvestrant and everolimus induced tumor regression in vivo in HBCx34 TamR, where we found a cross-talk between ER and PI3K pathways. Expression of several ER-controlled genes and ER co-regulators was significantly changed in both TamR and OvaR tumors, indicating impaired ER transcriptional activity. Expression changes associated with hormono-resistance were both tumor and treatment specific and were enriched for genes involved in cell growth, cell death and cell survival. Conclusions: PDX models of LBC with acquired resistance to endocrine therapies show a great diversity of resistance phenotype, associated to specific deregulations of ER-mediated gene transcription. These models offer a tool for developing anticancer therapies and to investigate the dynamics of resistance emerging during pharmacological interventions.','2014','Jun','19','2014-06-24 21:26:43',NULL,1,1),(859,3,'blindmurray@gmail.com','24947863','1439-0531','Reproduction in domestic animals = Zuchthygiene','Causes, diagnosis and therapy of common diseases in neonatal puppies in the first days of life: cornerstones of practical approach.','© 2014 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.','Neonatal diseases and losses are a common and often unavoidable problem within breeding kennels. Altogether, morbidity and mortality ranges, according to the literature, from 5 to 35%. Among non-infectious causes besides hypoxia during birth, hypothermia, hypoglycaemia and dehydration are mostly responsible for puppy diseases and losses. Approximately 90% of all deaths in hypoxaemic pups occur during the first 2 days. Of 183 pups with hypoxia, 63 died, 92.7% of them within 48 h after birth. Among infectious causes, bacterial infection is the most common cause of neonatal mortality. Escherichia coli, streptococci, staphylococci, Pseudomonas sp., Klebsiella sp., Enterobacter sp. and some other micro-organisms are regularly involved in neonatal infections. Post-mortem findings especially document E. coli, Staphylococcus sp. and Streptococcus sp. as responsible bacteria. The dam and the environment are suspected as sources of neonatal infections as it was shown by genetic relatedness of responsible bacterial strains isolated in both puppies and their dams. From a total of 517 puppies with bacterial infections, the treatment results documented that parenteral administration of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid in 308 neonates showed the best result. Diagnosis of diseases is often made difficult by the absence of variability in clinical signs contrary to adult dogs. Findings during a physical examination in pups differ from those in adults.

The pathophysiology remains unclear, although evidence exists that surgical trauma and the use of cardiopulmonary bypass provoke an immune response leading to PPS. We hypothesized that an intraoperative dose of dexamethasone decreases the risk of PPS, by reducing this inflammatory response.\r\nMETHODS:\r\nWe performed a subanalysis of the DECS study, which is a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial of 4,494 patients undergoing cardiac surgery with use of cardiopulmonary bypass. The aim of the DECS study was to investigate whether a single intraoperative dose of 1 mg/kg dexamethasone reduced the incidence of a composite of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, renal failure, or respiratory failure, within 30 days of randomization. In this substudy, we retrospectively analyzed the occurrence of PPS in 822 patients who were included in the DECS trial and underwent valvular surgery. Postpericardiotomy syndrome was diagnosed if 2 of 5 listed symptoms were present: unexplained fever, pleuritic chest pain, pericardial or pleural rub, new or worsening pericardial or pleural effusion. All medical charts, x-rays, and echocardiograms were reviewed. Secondary end point was the occurrence of complicated PPS, defined as PPS with need for evacuation of pleural effusion, pericardiocentesis, and tamponade requiring intervention or hospital readmission for PPS. This is a blinded, single-center, post hoc analysis.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nPostpericardiotomy syndrome occurred in 119 patients (14.5%). The incidence of PPS after dexamethasone compared with placebo was 13.5% vs 15.5% (relative risk 0.88, 95% CI 0.63-1.22).

Fibulin-6, an ECM protein is expressed in cell junctions particularly in tissues subjected to significant mechanical stress. Fibulin-6 deficiency results in defective cell migration in nematodes and early embryonic lethality in mice. The role of fibulin-6 in healthy and failing myocardium has not been described. We have examined the expression and distribution pattern of fibulin-6 during myocardial remodeling (MR) and detailed its effect on the migratory function of cardiac fibroblasts (CF) in response to TGF-β1.\r\nMETHODS AND RESULTS:\r\nIn healthy murine myocardium fibulin-6 expression is largely confined to larger coronary arteries. It is induced during the early and the late phase of remodeling after infarction in murine hearts predominantly in the scar-muscle junction. Similar results are obtained in human ischemic cardiomyopathy. Fibulin-6 is mostly expressed in close vicinity to vimentin positive cells and is also abundantly expressed in vitro in cultured neonatal CF. TGF-β1 does not induce smooth muscle actin in fibroblasts deficient of fibulin-6, which also compromised their migration. Cells that had migrated expressed more fibulin-6 compared to stationary cells. Plated on fibulin-6 depleted matrix, stress fiber induction in fibroblast in response to TGF-β1 was impaired. In ex vivo explant cultures from postinfarct myocardium, the number of emigrating fibroblasts was also significantly reduced by fibulin-6 siRNA knock down (KD).\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\nFibulin-6, a fibroblast released ECM protein may play an important role during myocardial remodeling by imparting an effect on cardiac fibroblast migration in close and complementary interplay with TGF-β1 signalling.','2014','Jun','20','2014-06-24 21:33:00',NULL,1,1),(863,1,'nick@masomurray.com','24948576','1569-9285','Interactive cardiovascular and thoracic surgery','Computational fluid dynamics of the right ventricular outflow tract and of the pulmonary artery: a bench model of flow dynamics.','© The Author 2014.

The reoperation rate at 5 years can be as high as 25% and depends on age, type of conduit, conduit diameter and principal heart malformation. The aim of this study is to provide a bench model with computer fluid dynamics to analyse the haemodynamics of the RVOT, pulmonary artery, its bifurcation, and left and right pulmonary arteries that in the future may serve as a tool for analysis and prediction of outcome following RVOT reconstruction.\r\nMETHODS:\r\nPressure, flow and diameter at the RVOT, pulmonary artery, bifurcation of the pulmonary artery, and left and right pulmonary arteries were measured in five normal pigs with a mean weight of 24.6 ± 0.89 kg. Data obtained were used for a 3D computer fluid-dynamics simulation of flow conditions, focusing on the pressure, flow and shear stress profile of the pulmonary trunk to the level of the left and right pulmonary arteries.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nThree inlet steady flow profiles were obtained at 0.2, 0.29 and 0.36 m/s that correspond to the flow rates of 1.5, 2.0 and 2.5 l/min flow at the RVOT. The flow velocity profile was constant at the RVOT down to the bifurcation and decreased at the left and right pulmonary arteries. In all three inlet velocity profiles, low sheer stress and low-velocity areas were detected along the left wall of the pulmonary artery, at the pulmonary artery bifurcation and at the ostia of both pulmonary arteries.\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\nThis computed fluid real-time model provides us with a realistic picture of fluid dynamics in the pulmonary tract area. Deep shear stress areas correspond to a turbulent flow profile that is a predictive factor for the development of vessel wall arteriosclerosis.

All patients with troponin elevation were then matched with 2 control patients without postoperative troponin elevation.

The type of procedure, perioperative antiplatelet therapy, and other patient-related factors influence the risk of postoperative haemorrhage. Our objective was to analyze the postoperative risk factors for hemorrhagic complications and to determine the impact of antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy strategies on postoperative bleeding risk in patients with coronary stents undergoing non-cardiac surgery.\r\nPATIENTS AND METHODS:\r\nProspective, multicentre observational cohort study of 1134 consecutive patients with coronary stents undergoing non-cardiac surgery between April 2007 and April 2009. The primary outcome measure was the occurrence of an hemorrhagic complication during the first 30days following the surgery or intervention.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nAmong the 1134 patients evaluated, 108 (9.5%) experienced a postoperative hemorrhagic complication (with a median time to occurrence of 5.3days).

Mortality in patients with a haemorrhagic complication was 12% (n=13). Independent postoperative factors associated with haemorrhagic complications were identified as a high and intermediate bleeding risk procedure and the use and dose of anticoagulants.

Significant systemic arterial hypotension occurred in 14 individuals (26%) and oxygen desaturation in 9 (17%) patients. Administration of an intravenous (IV) vasopressor agent during induction significantly decreased the incidence of hypotension. The type of IV induction agent did not influence hemodynamic alterations, though patients who received propofol experienced a trend towards increased hypotension (83% of pts) when a vasopressor was not used. Inhalational induction, regardless of vasopressor use, was more likely to result in hypotension (60% of pts). The 30-day mortality was 3.8% (two pts). Both patients had minor elective procedures with monitored anesthesia care (MAC).\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\nHypotension is more common in patients with Eisenmenger syndrome and similar physiology when a vasopressor is not used during the peri-induction period, regardless of induction agent. Etomidate tended to have better hemodynamic stability than other induction agents. The use of a vasopressor is recommended. We present general recommendations for anesthesiologists and strongly recommend use of a vasopressor before or during induction to reduce hypotension along with complete avoidance of inhalational induction.

Included patients were treated with 3 mg/kg of vernakalant over 10 min and, if unsuccessful, a second dose of 2 mg/kg. Blood pressure was measured continuously for 2 hours after treatment. Results. Of the 191 patients screened, 159 (83%) were excluded, most importantly due to hemodynamic instability (59%). Vernakalant was administered to 32 (17% of the screened) patients. Within 6 hours, 17 (53%) patients converted to sinus rhythm. Blood pressure did not decrease significantly 10, 30, 60, and 120 minutes after the vernakalant infusion.

While donor identity of DNA extracted directly from blood collected in standard tubes containing anticoagulants can be easily verified by generating STR profiles, RNA from blood collected in PAXgene Blood RNA tubes (PAXgene RNA tubes) is depleted of DNA and is not amenable to STR fingerprinting for donor identity verification. We investigated the feasibility of isolating DNA directly from blood collected in PAXgene RNA tubes for use as template for STR DNA fingerprinting for blood donor identity verification. We determined that DNA extraction can be performed manually with the QIAamp DNA Blood Minikit or on the QIAxtractor instrument with minimal pre-processing protocol additions, and that DNA isolated from blood collected in PAXgene RNA tubes is of sufficient quantity and quality for successful STR fingerprint analysis.

We therefore aimed to investigate the effects of isoflurane anesthesia on cognitive dysfunction in a diabetic rat model induced by a single injection of streptozotocin (STZ).

Simple rotation of the catheter, echocardiography-guided placement to the centre of the ventricle, or ventricular expansion through crystalloid infusion may correct for these artifacts. Fluid administration, however, alters left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and volume and therefore stroke volume, thereby obscuring continuous real-time haemodynamic measurements.\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\nPressure-volume artifacts during inotropic infusion are caused by physical contact of the catheter with endocardium.

The effect of antithrombotic drugs have been examined in experimental and clinical studies but results are still inconclusive. Thrombotic-related vascular disease such as myocardial infarction, stroke and venous thrombosis may complicate the clinical course of pneumonia and worsen its prognosis.

All rights reserved.','\r\nAIM OF THE STUDY:\r\nMast cell (MC) degranulation contributes to the protection mediated by ischemic preconditioning (IPC); however, the precise mechanisms underlying this protection remain largely unknown. Mast cell carboxypeptidase A (MC-CPA) is released solely from MCs and plays a critical role in degrading toxins and endothelin 1 (ET-1). The present study sought to explore whether MC-CPA is involved in the process of IPC in a rodent model of small intestinal ischemia reperfusion (IIR) injury.\r\nMATERIALS AND METHODS:\r\nIIR injuries were induced in Sprague-Dawley rats by clamping the superior mesenteric artery for 60 min followed by reperfusion for 2 h. One cycle of 10 min intestinal ischemia and 10 min of reperfusion was used in the IPC group, and the MC stabilizer cromolyn sodium and MC potato carboxypeptidase inhibitor were administered before the start of IPC. At the end of experiment, intestine tissue was obtained for assays of the MC-CPA3, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, and ET-1 contents and myeloperoxidase activities. Intestinal histologic injury scores and MC degranulation were assessed. Apoptosis indices and cleaved caspase- 3 protein expressions were quantified.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nIIR resulted in severe injury, as evidenced by significant increases in injury scores and MC-CPA3, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, and ET-1 contents that were accompanied with concomitant elevations in cleaved caspase 3 expression, apoptosis indices, and myeloperoxidase activities. IPC induced a significant increase in MC-CPA3, induced MC degranulation, and attenuated IIR injury by downregulating IIR-induced biochemical changes, whereas cromolyn sodium and potato carboxypeptidase inhibitor abolished the IPC-mediated changes.\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\nThese data suggest that IPC protected against IIR injury via the MC degranulation-mediated release of MC-CPA.','2014','May','23','2014-06-24 21:33:05',NULL,1,1),(900,2,'nickm@masomurray.com','24953890','1523-6838','American journal of kidney diseases : the official journal of the National Kidney Foundation','Serum Bicarbonate Concentrations and Kidney Disease Progression in Community-Living Elders: The Health, Aging, and Body Composition (Health ABC) Study.','Published by Elsevier Inc.','\r\nBACKGROUND:\r\nIn populations with prevalent chronic kidney disease (CKD), lower serum bicarbonate levels are associated with more rapid CKD progression, but whether lower bicarbonate levels also are associated with risk of incident estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)\r\nSTUDY DESIGN:\r\nLongitudinal observational cohort study.\r\nSETTING & PARTICIPANTS:\r\nWell-functioning community-living elders aged 70-79 years at inception.\r\nPREDICTOR:\r\nSerum bicarbonate level measured at the time of collection by arterialized venous blood sample using an arterial blood gas analyzer.\r\nOUTCOMES:\r\nChange in eGFR over 7 years, and new eGFR\r\nMEASUREMENTS:\r\nLinear and logistic regressions were used to evaluate associations of baseline serum bicarbonate level with change in eGFR and incident eGFR\r\nRESULTS:\r\nAt baseline, mean eGFR was 84±16 (SD)mL/min/1.73m(2), and serum bicarbonate level was 25.2±1.9mmol/L.

The in vivo role of FoxO1 in the regulation of cardiac NaV1.5 expression remains unknown. The present study aimed to define the role of FoxO1 in the regulation of NaV1.5 expression and cardiac Na(+) channel activity in mouse ventricular cardiomyocytes and assess the cardiac electrophysiological phenotype of mice with cardiac FoxO1 deletion. Tamoxifen-induced and cardiac-specific FoxO1 deletion was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Cardiac FoxO1 deletion failed to result in either cardiac functional changes or hypertrophy as assessed by echocardiography and individual ventricular cell capacitances, respectively. Western blotting showed that FoxO1 was significantly decreased while NaV1.5 protein level was significantly increased in mouse hearts with FoxO1 deletion. Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) revealed that FoxO1 deletion led to an increase in NaV1.5 and Na(+) channel subunit β3 mRNA, but not β1, 2, 4, or connexin 43. Whole patch-clamp recordings demonstrated that cardiac Na(+) currents were significantly augmented by FoxO1 deletion without affecting the steady-state activation and inactivation, leading to accelerated depolarization of action potentials in mouse ventricular cardiomyocytes. Electrocardiogram recordings showed that the QRS complex was significantly shortened and P wave amplitude was significantly increased in conscious and unrestrained mice with cardiac FoxO1 deletion. NaV1.5 expression was decreased in the peri-infarct (border-zone) of mice with myocardial infarction and FoxO1 accumulated in the cardiomyocyte nuclei of chronic ischemic human hearts. Our findings indicate that FoxO1 plays an important role in the regulation of NaV1.5 and β3 subunit expression as well as Na(+) channel activity in the heart and that FoxO1 is involved in the modulation of NaV1.5 expression in ischemic heart disease.','2014','Jun','20','2014-06-24 21:33:08',NULL,1,1),(902,3,'blindmurray@gmail.com','24955355','2314-6141','BioMed research international','Recombinant Human Factor IX Produced from Transgenic Porcine Milk.','','Production of biopharmaceuticals from transgenic animal milk is a cost-effective method for highly complex proteins that cannot be efficiently produced using conventional systems such as microorganisms or animal cells.

The purpose of this work was to test the possibility that the facilitation of lordosis behavior in estrogen-primed rats by progesterone (P) and its 5α- and 5β-reduced metabolites, gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH), leptin, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and vagino-cervical stimulation (VCS) involves interactions with classical ERs by using the selective ER modulator, tamoxifen. To further assess the role of ERs, we also explored the effects of the pure ER antagonist, ICI182780 (ICI), on estrous behavior induced by P and GnRH. Ovariectomized, estrogen-primed rats (5 μg estradiol benzoate 40 hr earlier) were injected intraventricularly with the above-mentioned compounds, or they received VCS. All compounds and VCS effectively facilitated estrous behavior when tested at 60, 120 or 240 min after infusion or application of VCS. Intraventricular infusion of tamoxifen (5 μg), 30 min prior, significantly attenuated estrous behaviors induced in estradiol-primed rats by P, most of its 5α- and 5β-reduced metabolites, GnRH, and PGE2, but not by VCS. Although there was a trend for reduction, tamoxifen did not significantly decrease lordosis in females treated with 5β-pregnan-3,20-dione.

Twenty-milliliter portions of red blood cells (RBCs) were added and processed under various conditions, including clinically relevant first filling and intermittent emptying. RBC recovery and availability and plasma elimination were calculated from the Hct, free hemoglobin, and total protein.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nThe main impediment to recovery and availability was the first filling. There, RBC recovery was significantly reduced, while it subsequently varied between 93 and 98%. To produce the first 30 mL of RBCs, ELECTA required 42 mL and C.A.T.S and OrthoPAT 62 mL owing to the dead space of the separation chamber or reservoir, respectively. RBC availability was much higher in subsequent processes, with only minimal differences between the three devices. They all consistently provided high plasma elimination rates.\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\nThe continuous system showed no advantage over a small Latham bowl.

Pre-menopausal women were allocated to radiotherapy (RT), RT+oral cyclophosphamide (RT+C) or cyclophosphamide only (C). Post-menopausal women were allocated to RT, RT+Tamoxifen for one year (RT+Tam) or tamoxifen only (Tam). Information on admission to hospital, mortality and causes of death was obtained from national registers.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nAfter 25years, adding RT to cyclophosphamide in pre-menopausal women raised the mortality from heart disease from zero to 0.8% (p=0.04). In post-menopausal women, adding RT to Tam raised the mortality from heart disease from 10.5% to 18.4% (p=0.005). In post-menopausal women mortality due to cerebrovascular disease increased from 3.4% to 8.7% by adding RT to Tam (p=0.015). The differences were not evident until in the second decade of follow-up.

These studies have raised significant safety concerns regarding the use of anesthetics in the pediatric population and highlight the need for a better model to study anesthetic-induced neurotoxicity in humans. Human embryonic stem cells are capable of differentiating into any cell type and represent a promising model to study mechanisms governing anesthetic-induced neurotoxicity.\r\nMETHODS::\r\nCell death in human embryonic stem cell-derived neurons was assessed using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate in situ nick end labeling staining, and microRNA expression was assessed using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. miR-21 was overexpressed and knocked down using an miR-21 mimic and antagomir, respectively. Sprouty 2 was knocked down using a small interfering RNA, and the expression of the miR-21 targets of interest was assessed by Western blot.\r\nRESULTS::\r\nPropofol dose and exposure time dependently induced significant cell death (n = 3) in the neurons and down-regulated several microRNAs, including miR-21. Overexpression of miR-21 and knockdown of Sprouty 2 attenuated the increase in terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate in situ nick end labeling-positive cells following propofol exposure. In addition, miR-21 knockdown increased the number of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate in situ nick end labeling-positive cells by 30% (n = 5). Finally, activated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 and protein kinase B (Akt) were down-regulated, and Sprouty 2 was up-regulated following propofol exposure (n = 3).\r\nCONCLUSIONS::\r\nThese data suggest that (1) human embryonic stem cell-derived neurons represent a promising in vitro human model for studying anesthetic-induced neurotoxicity, (2) propofol induces cell death in human embryonic stem cell-derived neurons, and (3) the propofol-induced cell death may occur via a signal transducer and activator of transcription 3/miR-21/Sprouty 2-dependent mechanism.','2014','Jun','19','2014-06-24 21:33:08',NULL,1,1),(915,3,'blindmurray@gmail.com','24949934','1878-5867','Steroids','The evolution of nonsteroidal antiestrogens to become selective estrogen receptor modulators.','Copyright © 2014.

Therefore, the diagnosis can be missed until complications such as perforation or hemorrhage occur. Few reports have investigated the procedures and outcomes of children who have undergone operations for perforated duodenal ulcers. We report our experience with the modified Graham technique for perforated duodenal ulcers in nine children and review the literature. Methods : The records of patients operated on for a perforated duodenal ulcer in the last 8 years in two pediatric surgery centers were evaluated retrospectively. Patient demographics, symptoms, time to admission to hospital, operative findings, and postoperative clinical course were evaluated. Results : Nine children (mean age 13.2 years, range 6-170 years) were included. All patients were admitted in the first six hours after their abdominal pain started. In three patients, there was free air on plain x-rays, while the x-rays were normal in six. All perforations were located on the anterior surface of the first part of the duodenum and repaired with primary suturing and Graham patch omentoplasty. The recovery was uneventful in all patients. In five patients, urea breath tests were performed postoperatively for Helicobacter Pylori, and the results were positive. All patients underwent triple therapy with lansoprazole, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin. The mean follow-up time was 58 (range 3-94) months. Conclusions : Peptic ulcer perforation should be suspected in children who have acute abdominal pain and peritoneal signs, especially when their suffering is intense.

We investigated the molecular changes associated with acquired hormono-resistances in patient-derived xenografts of LBC. Experimental design: Two LBC xenografts (HBCx22 and HBCx34) were treated with different endocrine therapies (ET) to obtain xenografts with acquired resistances to tamoxifen (TamR) and ovariectomy (OvaR). PI3K pathway activation was analyzed by western blot and immunohistochemistry and responses to ET combined to everolimus were investigated in vivo. Gene expression analyses were performed by RT-PCR and Affymetrix arrays. Results: HBCx22 TamR xenograft was cross-resistant to several hormono-therapies, while HBCx22 OvaR and HBCx34 TamR exhibited a treatment specific resistance profile. PI3K pathway was similarly activated in parental and resistant xenografts but the addition of everolimus didn\'t restore the response to tamoxifen in TamR xenografts. By contrast, the combination of fulvestrant and everolimus induced tumor regression in vivo in HBCx34 TamR, where we found a cross-talk between ER and PI3K pathways. Expression of several ER-controlled genes and ER co-regulators was significantly changed in both TamR and OvaR tumors, indicating impaired ER transcriptional activity. Expression changes associated with hormono-resistance were both tumor and treatment specific and were enriched for genes involved in cell growth, cell death and cell survival. Conclusions: PDX models of LBC with acquired resistance to endocrine therapies show a great diversity of resistance phenotype, associated to specific deregulations of ER-mediated gene transcription. These models offer a tool for developing anticancer therapies and to investigate the dynamics of resistance emerging during pharmacological interventions.','2014','Jun','19','2014-06-24 21:33:08',NULL,1,1),(919,3,'blindmurray@gmail.com','24947863','1439-0531','Reproduction in domestic animals = Zuchthygiene','Causes, diagnosis and therapy of common diseases in neonatal puppies in the first days of life: cornerstones of practical approach.','© 2014 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.','Neonatal diseases and losses are a common and often unavoidable problem within breeding kennels. Altogether, morbidity and mortality ranges, according to the literature, from 5 to 35%. Among non-infectious causes besides hypoxia during birth, hypothermia, hypoglycaemia and dehydration are mostly responsible for puppy diseases and losses. Approximately 90% of all deaths in hypoxaemic pups occur during the first 2 days. Of 183 pups with hypoxia, 63 died, 92.7% of them within 48 h after birth. Among infectious causes, bacterial infection is the most common cause of neonatal mortality. Escherichia coli, streptococci, staphylococci, Pseudomonas sp., Klebsiella sp., Enterobacter sp. and some other micro-organisms are regularly involved in neonatal infections. Post-mortem findings especially document E. coli, Staphylococcus sp. and Streptococcus sp. as responsible bacteria. The dam and the environment are suspected as sources of neonatal infections as it was shown by genetic relatedness of responsible bacterial strains isolated in both puppies and their dams. From a total of 517 puppies with bacterial infections, the treatment results documented that parenteral administration of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid in 308 neonates showed the best result. Diagnosis of diseases is often made difficult by the absence of variability in clinical signs contrary to adult dogs. Findings during a physical examination in pups differ from those in adults.

The pathophysiology remains unclear, although evidence exists that surgical trauma and the use of cardiopulmonary bypass provoke an immune response leading to PPS. We hypothesized that an intraoperative dose of dexamethasone decreases the risk of PPS, by reducing this inflammatory response.\r\nMETHODS:\r\nWe performed a subanalysis of the DECS study, which is a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial of 4,494 patients undergoing cardiac surgery with use of cardiopulmonary bypass. The aim of the DECS study was to investigate whether a single intraoperative dose of 1 mg/kg dexamethasone reduced the incidence of a composite of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, renal failure, or respiratory failure, within 30 days of randomization. In this substudy, we retrospectively analyzed the occurrence of PPS in 822 patients who were included in the DECS trial and underwent valvular surgery. Postpericardiotomy syndrome was diagnosed if 2 of 5 listed symptoms were present: unexplained fever, pleuritic chest pain, pericardial or pleural rub, new or worsening pericardial or pleural effusion. All medical charts, x-rays, and echocardiograms were reviewed. Secondary end point was the occurrence of complicated PPS, defined as PPS with need for evacuation of pleural effusion, pericardiocentesis, and tamponade requiring intervention or hospital readmission for PPS. This is a blinded, single-center, post hoc analysis.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nPostpericardiotomy syndrome occurred in 119 patients (14.5%).

Fibulin-6, an ECM protein is expressed in cell junctions particularly in tissues subjected to significant mechanical stress. Fibulin-6 deficiency results in defective cell migration in nematodes and early embryonic lethality in mice. The role of fibulin-6 in healthy and failing myocardium has not been described. We have examined the expression and distribution pattern of fibulin-6 during myocardial remodeling (MR) and detailed its effect on the migratory function of cardiac fibroblasts (CF) in response to TGF-β1.\r\nMETHODS AND RESULTS:\r\nIn healthy murine myocardium fibulin-6 expression is largely confined to larger coronary arteries. It is induced during the early and the late phase of remodeling after infarction in murine hearts predominantly in the scar-muscle junction. Similar results are obtained in human ischemic cardiomyopathy. Fibulin-6 is mostly expressed in close vicinity to vimentin positive cells and is also abundantly expressed in vitro in cultured neonatal CF. TGF-β1 does not induce smooth muscle actin in fibroblasts deficient of fibulin-6, which also compromised their migration. Cells that had migrated expressed more fibulin-6 compared to stationary cells. Plated on fibulin-6 depleted matrix, stress fiber induction in fibroblast in response to TGF-β1 was impaired. In ex vivo explant cultures from postinfarct myocardium, the number of emigrating fibroblasts was also significantly reduced by fibulin-6 siRNA knock down (KD).\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\nFibulin-6, a fibroblast released ECM protein may play an important role during myocardial remodeling by imparting an effect on cardiac fibroblast migration in close and complementary interplay with TGF-β1 signalling.','2014','Jun','20','2014-06-24 21:35:32',NULL,1,1),(923,1,'nick@masomurray.com','24948576','1569-9285','Interactive cardiovascular and thoracic surgery','Computational fluid dynamics of the right ventricular outflow tract and of the pulmonary artery: a bench model of flow dynamics.','© The Author 2014.

The reoperation rate at 5 years can be as high as 25% and depends on age, type of conduit, conduit diameter and principal heart malformation. The aim of this study is to provide a bench model with computer fluid dynamics to analyse the haemodynamics of the RVOT, pulmonary artery, its bifurcation, and left and right pulmonary arteries that in the future may serve as a tool for analysis and prediction of outcome following RVOT reconstruction.\r\nMETHODS:\r\nPressure, flow and diameter at the RVOT, pulmonary artery, bifurcation of the pulmonary artery, and left and right pulmonary arteries were measured in five normal pigs with a mean weight of 24.6 ± 0.89 kg. Data obtained were used for a 3D computer fluid-dynamics simulation of flow conditions, focusing on the pressure, flow and shear stress profile of the pulmonary trunk to the level of the left and right pulmonary arteries.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nThree inlet steady flow profiles were obtained at 0.2, 0.29 and 0.36 m/s that correspond to the flow rates of 1.5, 2.0 and 2.5 l/min flow at the RVOT. The flow velocity profile was constant at the RVOT down to the bifurcation and decreased at the left and right pulmonary arteries. In all three inlet velocity profiles, low sheer stress and low-velocity areas were detected along the left wall of the pulmonary artery, at the pulmonary artery bifurcation and at the ostia of both pulmonary arteries.\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\nThis computed fluid real-time model provides us with a realistic picture of fluid dynamics in the pulmonary tract area. Deep shear stress areas correspond to a turbulent flow profile that is a predictive factor for the development of vessel wall arteriosclerosis.

The type of procedure, perioperative antiplatelet therapy, and other patient-related factors influence the risk of postoperative haemorrhage. Our objective was to analyze the postoperative risk factors for hemorrhagic complications and to determine the impact of antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy strategies on postoperative bleeding risk in patients with coronary stents undergoing non-cardiac surgery.\r\nPATIENTS AND METHODS:\r\nProspective, multicentre observational cohort study of 1134 consecutive patients with coronary stents undergoing non-cardiac surgery between April 2007 and April 2009. The primary outcome measure was the occurrence of an hemorrhagic complication during the first 30days following the surgery or intervention.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nAmong the 1134 patients evaluated, 108 (9.5%) experienced a postoperative hemorrhagic complication (with a median time to occurrence of 5.3days).

Mortality in patients with a haemorrhagic complication was 12% (n=13). Independent postoperative factors associated with haemorrhagic complications were identified as a high and intermediate bleeding risk procedure and the use and dose of anticoagulants.

Both patients had minor elective procedures with monitored anesthesia care (MAC).\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\nHypotension is more common in patients with Eisenmenger syndrome and similar physiology when a vasopressor is not used during the peri-induction period, regardless of induction agent. Etomidate tended to have better hemodynamic stability than other induction agents. The use of a vasopressor is recommended. We present general recommendations for anesthesiologists and strongly recommend use of a vasopressor before or during induction to reduce hypotension along with complete avoidance of inhalational induction. Further, MAC anesthesia has been associated with perioperative and 30-day mortality.','2014','Jun','4','2014-06-24 21:35:32',NULL,1,1),(929,1,'nick@masomurray.com','24906370','2047-9980','Journal of the American Heart Association','Assessment of a university of california, los angeles 4-variable risk score for advanced heart failure.','© 2014 The Authors.

The outcome was survival free from urgent transplantation or LVAD. The model-predicted survival was compared to Kaplan-Meier\'s estimated survival at 1, 2, and 3 years. Model discrimination and calibration were assessed. During a mean follow-up of 2.1 years, 37 (21%) events occurred. One-, 2- and 3-year observed event-free survival was 88%, 81%, and 75%, and the observed/predicted ratio was 0.97, 0.96, and 0.97, respectively. Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curve analyses demonstrated good discrimination overall (1-year area under curve, 0.801; 2-year, 0.774; 3-year, 0.837), but discrimination between the 2 highest risk groups was poor. The difference between observed and predicted survival ranged from -14 to +17 percentage points, suggesting poor model calibration. Fairly similar results were found when the analyses were repeated in 715 patients after multivariate imputation of missing data.\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\nThe UCLA 4-variable risk model calibration was inconsistent and high-risk discrimination was poor in an external validation cohort.

While donor identity of DNA extracted directly from blood collected in standard tubes containing anticoagulants can be easily verified by generating STR profiles, RNA from blood collected in PAXgene Blood RNA tubes (PAXgene RNA tubes) is depleted of DNA and is not amenable to STR fingerprinting for donor identity verification.

We determined that DNA extraction can be performed manually with the QIAamp DNA Blood Minikit or on the QIAxtractor instrument with minimal pre-processing protocol additions, and that DNA isolated from blood collected in PAXgene RNA tubes is of sufficient quantity and quality for successful STR fingerprint analysis.

We therefore aimed to investigate the effects of isoflurane anesthesia on cognitive dysfunction in a diabetic rat model induced by a single injection of streptozotocin (STZ).

Simple rotation of the catheter, echocardiography-guided placement to the centre of the ventricle, or ventricular expansion through crystalloid infusion may correct for these artifacts. Fluid administration, however, alters left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and volume and therefore stroke volume, thereby obscuring continuous real-time haemodynamic measurements.\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\nPressure-volume artifacts during inotropic infusion are caused by physical contact of the catheter with endocardium.

All rights reserved.','\r\nAIM OF THE STUDY:\r\nMast cell (MC) degranulation contributes to the protection mediated by ischemic preconditioning (IPC); however, the precise mechanisms underlying this protection remain largely unknown. Mast cell carboxypeptidase A (MC-CPA) is released solely from MCs and plays a critical role in degrading toxins and endothelin 1 (ET-1). The present study sought to explore whether MC-CPA is involved in the process of IPC in a rodent model of small intestinal ischemia reperfusion (IIR) injury.\r\nMATERIALS AND METHODS:\r\nIIR injuries were induced in Sprague-Dawley rats by clamping the superior mesenteric artery for 60 min followed by reperfusion for 2 h. One cycle of 10 min intestinal ischemia and 10 min of reperfusion was used in the IPC group, and the MC stabilizer cromolyn sodium and MC potato carboxypeptidase inhibitor were administered before the start of IPC. At the end of experiment, intestine tissue was obtained for assays of the MC-CPA3, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, and ET-1 contents and myeloperoxidase activities. Intestinal histologic injury scores and MC degranulation were assessed. Apoptosis indices and cleaved caspase- 3 protein expressions were quantified.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nIIR resulted in severe injury, as evidenced by significant increases in injury scores and MC-CPA3, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, and ET-1 contents that were accompanied with concomitant elevations in cleaved caspase 3 expression, apoptosis indices, and myeloperoxidase activities. IPC induced a significant increase in MC-CPA3, induced MC degranulation, and attenuated IIR injury by downregulating IIR-induced biochemical changes, whereas cromolyn sodium and potato carboxypeptidase inhibitor abolished the IPC-mediated changes.\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\nThese data suggest that IPC protected against IIR injury via the MC degranulation-mediated release of MC-CPA.','2014','May','23','2014-06-24 21:35:36',NULL,1,1),(960,2,'nickm@masomurray.com','24953890','1523-6838','American journal of kidney diseases : the official journal of the National Kidney Foundation','Serum Bicarbonate Concentrations and Kidney Disease Progression in Community-Living Elders: The Health, Aging, and Body Composition (Health ABC) Study.','Published by Elsevier Inc.','\r\nBACKGROUND:\r\nIn populations with prevalent chronic kidney disease (CKD), lower serum bicarbonate levels are associated with more rapid CKD progression, but whether lower bicarbonate levels also are associated with risk of incident estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)\r\nSTUDY DESIGN:\r\nLongitudinal observational cohort study.\r\nSETTING & PARTICIPANTS:\r\nWell-functioning community-living elders aged 70-79 years at inception.\r\nPREDICTOR:\r\nSerum bicarbonate level measured at the time of collection by arterialized venous blood sample using an arterial blood gas analyzer.\r\nOUTCOMES:\r\nChange in eGFR over 7 years, and new eGFR\r\nMEASUREMENTS:\r\nLinear and logistic regressions were used to evaluate associations of baseline serum bicarbonate level with change in eGFR and incident eGFR\r\nRESULTS:\r\nAt baseline, mean eGFR was 84±16 (SD)mL/min/1.73m(2), and serum bicarbonate level was 25.2±1.9mmol/L.

The in vivo role of FoxO1 in the regulation of cardiac NaV1.5 expression remains unknown. The present study aimed to define the role of FoxO1 in the regulation of NaV1.5 expression and cardiac Na(+) channel activity in mouse ventricular cardiomyocytes and assess the cardiac electrophysiological phenotype of mice with cardiac FoxO1 deletion. Tamoxifen-induced and cardiac-specific FoxO1 deletion was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Cardiac FoxO1 deletion failed to result in either cardiac functional changes or hypertrophy as assessed by echocardiography and individual ventricular cell capacitances, respectively. Western blotting showed that FoxO1 was significantly decreased while NaV1.5 protein level was significantly increased in mouse hearts with FoxO1 deletion. Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) revealed that FoxO1 deletion led to an increase in NaV1.5 and Na(+) channel subunit β3 mRNA, but not β1, 2, 4, or connexin 43. Whole patch-clamp recordings demonstrated that cardiac Na(+) currents were significantly augmented by FoxO1 deletion without affecting the steady-state activation and inactivation, leading to accelerated depolarization of action potentials in mouse ventricular cardiomyocytes. Electrocardiogram recordings showed that the QRS complex was significantly shortened and P wave amplitude was significantly increased in conscious and unrestrained mice with cardiac FoxO1 deletion. NaV1.5 expression was decreased in the peri-infarct (border-zone) of mice with myocardial infarction and FoxO1 accumulated in the cardiomyocyte nuclei of chronic ischemic human hearts. Our findings indicate that FoxO1 plays an important role in the regulation of NaV1.5 and β3 subunit expression as well as Na(+) channel activity in the heart and that FoxO1 is involved in the modulation of NaV1.5 expression in ischemic heart disease.','2014','Jun','20','2014-06-24 21:35:40',NULL,1,1),(962,3,'blindmurray@gmail.com','24955355','2314-6141','BioMed research international','Recombinant Human Factor IX Produced from Transgenic Porcine Milk.','','Production of biopharmaceuticals from transgenic animal milk is a cost-effective method for highly complex proteins that cannot be efficiently produced using conventional systems such as microorganisms or animal cells.

To further assess the role of ERs, we also explored the effects of the pure ER antagonist, ICI182780 (ICI), on estrous behavior induced by P and GnRH. Ovariectomized, estrogen-primed rats (5 μg estradiol benzoate 40 hr earlier) were injected intraventricularly with the above-mentioned compounds, or they received VCS. All compounds and VCS effectively facilitated estrous behavior when tested at 60, 120 or 240 min after infusion or application of VCS. Intraventricular infusion of tamoxifen (5 μg), 30 min prior, significantly attenuated estrous behaviors induced in estradiol-primed rats by P, most of its 5α- and 5β-reduced metabolites, GnRH, and PGE2, but not by VCS. Although there was a trend for reduction, tamoxifen did not significantly decrease lordosis in females treated with 5β-pregnan-3,20-dione.

Twenty-milliliter portions of red blood cells (RBCs) were added and processed under various conditions, including clinically relevant first filling and intermittent emptying. RBC recovery and availability and plasma elimination were calculated from the Hct, free hemoglobin, and total protein.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nThe main impediment to recovery and availability was the first filling. There, RBC recovery was significantly reduced, while it subsequently varied between 93 and 98%. To produce the first 30 mL of RBCs, ELECTA required 42 mL and C.A.T.S and OrthoPAT 62 mL owing to the dead space of the separation chamber or reservoir, respectively. RBC availability was much higher in subsequent processes, with only minimal differences between the three devices. They all consistently provided high plasma elimination rates.\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\nThe continuous system showed no advantage over a small Latham bowl.

For each woman who used tamoxifen, the starting and stopping dates were abstracted and the duration of tamoxifen use was calculated. Three hundred and thirty-one women had used tamoxifen (22 %); of these 84 (25 %) had completed four or more years of tamoxifen, the remainder stopped prematurely or were current users. For women with up to 1 year of tamoxifen use, the odds ratio for contralateral breast cancer was 0.37 (95 % CI 0.20-0.69; p = 0.001) compared to women with no tamoxifen use. Among women with 1-4 years of tamoxifen use the odds ratio was 0.53 (95 % CI 0.32-0.87; p = 0.01). Among women with four or more years of tamoxifen use the odds ratio was 0.83 (95 % CI 0.44-1.55; p = 0.55). Short-term use of tamoxifen for chemoprevention in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers may be as effective as a conventional 5-year course of treatment.','2014','Jun','21','2014-06-24 21:35:40',NULL,1,1),(972,3,'blindmurray@gmail.com','24951164','1879-0852','European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)','Increased cardio and cerebrovascular mortality in breast cancer patients treated with postmastectomy radiotherapy - 25 year follow-up of a randomised trial from the South Sweden Breast Cancer Group.','Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.','\r\nAIM OF THE STUDY:\r\nTo analyse late morbidity and mortality in pre and post-menopausal breast cancer patients treated with postmastectomy radiotherapy, with emphasis on side-effects from the heart, cerebrovascular and respiratory systems.\r\nMETHODS:\r\nLong term follow-up of two randomised, clinical trials with 1100 patients was carried out. Pre-menopausal women were allocated to radiotherapy (RT), RT+oral cyclophosphamide (RT+C) or cyclophosphamide only (C). Post-menopausal women were allocated to RT, RT+Tamoxifen for one year (RT+Tam) or tamoxifen only (Tam). Information on admission to hospital, mortality and causes of death was obtained from national registers.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nAfter 25years, adding RT to cyclophosphamide in pre-menopausal women raised the mortality from heart disease from zero to 0.8% (p=0.04). In post-menopausal women, adding RT to Tam raised the mortality from heart disease from 10.5% to 18.4% (p=0.005). In post-menopausal women mortality due to cerebrovascular disease increased from 3.4% to 8.7% by adding RT to Tam (p=0.015). The differences were not evident until in the second decade of follow-up. In spite of differences in specific causes of death, there were no significant differences between the treatment arms concerning morbidity or overall mortality.\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\nPostmastectomy radiotherapy to the chest wall and loco-regional lymph nodes including the parasternal lymph nodes as delivered in the end of the seventies did not reduce overall mortality, but gave a significantly increased risk of death from heart and cerebrovascular disease, which appeared during the second decade after radiotherapy.','2014','Jun','17','2014-06-24 21:35:40',NULL,1,1),(973,3,'blindmurray@gmail.com','24950299','1932-6203','PloS one','Generation and Characterization of an Nse-CreERT2 Transgenic Line Suitable for Inducible Gene Manipulation in Cerebellar Granule Cells.','','We created an Nse-CreERT2 mouse line expressing the tamoxifen-inducible CreERT2 recombinase under the control of the neuron-specific enolase (Nse) promoter.

These studies have raised significant safety concerns regarding the use of anesthetics in the pediatric population and highlight the need for a better model to study anesthetic-induced neurotoxicity in humans. Human embryonic stem cells are capable of differentiating into any cell type and represent a promising model to study mechanisms governing anesthetic-induced neurotoxicity.\r\nMETHODS::\r\nCell death in human embryonic stem cell-derived neurons was assessed using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate in situ nick end labeling staining, and microRNA expression was assessed using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. miR-21 was overexpressed and knocked down using an miR-21 mimic and antagomir, respectively. Sprouty 2 was knocked down using a small interfering RNA, and the expression of the miR-21 targets of interest was assessed by Western blot.\r\nRESULTS::\r\nPropofol dose and exposure time dependently induced significant cell death (n = 3) in the neurons and down-regulated several microRNAs, including miR-21. Overexpression of miR-21 and knockdown of Sprouty 2 attenuated the increase in terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate in situ nick end labeling-positive cells following propofol exposure. In addition, miR-21 knockdown increased the number of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate in situ nick end labeling-positive cells by 30% (n = 5). Finally, activated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 and protein kinase B (Akt) were down-regulated, and Sprouty 2 was up-regulated following propofol exposure (n = 3).\r\nCONCLUSIONS::\r\nThese data suggest that (1) human embryonic stem cell-derived neurons represent a promising in vitro human model for studying anesthetic-induced neurotoxicity, (2) propofol induces cell death in human embryonic stem cell-derived neurons, and (3) the propofol-induced cell death may occur via a signal transducer and activator of transcription 3/miR-21/Sprouty 2-dependent mechanism.','2014','Jun','19','2014-06-24 21:35:40',NULL,1,1),(975,3,'blindmurray@gmail.com','24949934','1878-5867','Steroids','The evolution of nonsteroidal antiestrogens to become selective estrogen receptor modulators.','Copyright © 2014.

Therefore, the diagnosis can be missed until complications such as perforation or hemorrhage occur. Few reports have investigated the procedures and outcomes of children who have undergone operations for perforated duodenal ulcers. We report our experience with the modified Graham technique for perforated duodenal ulcers in nine children and review the literature. Methods : The records of patients operated on for a perforated duodenal ulcer in the last 8 years in two pediatric surgery centers were evaluated retrospectively. Patient demographics, symptoms, time to admission to hospital, operative findings, and postoperative clinical course were evaluated. Results : Nine children (mean age 13.2 years, range 6-170 years) were included. All patients were admitted in the first six hours after their abdominal pain started. In three patients, there was free air on plain x-rays, while the x-rays were normal in six. All perforations were located on the anterior surface of the first part of the duodenum and repaired with primary suturing and Graham patch omentoplasty. The recovery was uneventful in all patients. In five patients, urea breath tests were performed postoperatively for Helicobacter Pylori, and the results were positive. All patients underwent triple therapy with lansoprazole, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin. The mean follow-up time was 58 (range 3-94) months. Conclusions : Peptic ulcer perforation should be suspected in children who have acute abdominal pain and peritoneal signs, especially when their suffering is intense. The simple patch repair and postoperative triple therapy for Helicobacter Pylori are safe and satisfactory for treating peptic ulcer perforation in children.','2014','May','','2014-06-24 21:35:40',NULL,1,1),(978,3,'blindmurray@gmail.com','24947930','1078-0432','Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research','Acquired resistance to endocrine treatments is associated to tumor-specific molecular changes in patient-derived luminal breast cancer xenografts.','Copyright © 2014, American Association for Cancer Research.','Purpose: patients with luminal breast cancer (LBC) often become endocrine-resistant over time. We investigated the molecular changes associated with acquired hormono-resistances in patient-derived xenografts of LBC. Experimental design: Two LBC xenografts (HBCx22 and HBCx34) were treated with different endocrine therapies (ET) to obtain xenografts with acquired resistances to tamoxifen (TamR) and ovariectomy (OvaR). PI3K pathway activation was analyzed by western blot and immunohistochemistry and responses to ET combined to everolimus were investigated in vivo. Gene expression analyses were performed by RT-PCR and Affymetrix arrays. Results: HBCx22 TamR xenograft was cross-resistant to several hormono-therapies, while HBCx22 OvaR and HBCx34 TamR exhibited a treatment specific resistance profile. PI3K pathway was similarly activated in parental and resistant xenografts but the addition of everolimus didn\'t restore the response to tamoxifen in TamR xenografts. By contrast, the combination of fulvestrant and everolimus induced tumor regression in vivo in HBCx34 TamR, where we found a cross-talk between ER and PI3K pathways. Expression of several ER-controlled genes and ER co-regulators was significantly changed in both TamR and OvaR tumors, indicating impaired ER transcriptional activity. Expression changes associated with hormono-resistance were both tumor and treatment specific and were enriched for genes involved in cell growth, cell death and cell survival. Conclusions: PDX models of LBC with acquired resistance to endocrine therapies show a great diversity of resistance phenotype, associated to specific deregulations of ER-mediated gene transcription. These models offer a tool for developing anticancer therapies and to investigate the dynamics of resistance emerging during pharmacological interventions.','2014','Jun','19','2014-06-24 21:35:40',NULL,1,1),(979,3,'blindmurray@gmail.com','24947863','1439-0531','Reproduction in domestic animals = Zuchthygiene','Causes, diagnosis and therapy of common diseases in neonatal puppies in the first days of life: cornerstones of practical approach.','© 2014 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.','Neonatal diseases and losses are a common and often unavoidable problem within breeding kennels. Altogether, morbidity and mortality ranges, according to the literature, from 5 to 35%. Among non-infectious causes besides hypoxia during birth, hypothermia, hypoglycaemia and dehydration are mostly responsible for puppy diseases and losses. Approximately 90% of all deaths in hypoxaemic pups occur during the first 2 days. Of 183 pups with hypoxia, 63 died, 92.7% of them within 48 h after birth. Among infectious causes, bacterial infection is the most common cause of neonatal mortality. Escherichia coli, streptococci, staphylococci, Pseudomonas sp., Klebsiella sp., Enterobacter sp. and some other micro-organisms are regularly involved in neonatal infections. Post-mortem findings especially document E. coli, Staphylococcus sp. and Streptococcus sp. as responsible bacteria. The dam and the environment are suspected as sources of neonatal infections as it was shown by genetic relatedness of responsible bacterial strains isolated in both puppies and their dams. From a total of 517 puppies with bacterial infections, the treatment results documented that parenteral administration of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid in 308 neonates showed the best result. Diagnosis of diseases is often made difficult by the absence of variability in clinical signs contrary to adult dogs. Findings during a physical examination in pups differ from those in adults. Furthermore, treatment recommendations have to meet the special conditions in neonates concerning drug metabolism and excretion.','2014','Jun','','2014-06-24 21:35:40',NULL,1,1),(980,3,'blindmurray@gmail.com','24947736','1471-2431','BMC pediatrics','Haemophilus influenzae type b as an important cause of culture-positive acute otitis media in young children in Thailand: a tympanocentesis-based, multi-center, cross-sectional study.','','\r\nBACKGROUND:\r\nStreptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) and Haemophilus influenzae (H. influenzae) are considered major causes of bacterial acute otitis media (AOM) worldwide, but data from Asia on primary causes of AOM are limited.

The most common pneumococcal serotypes were 19 F (26%) and 14 (22%). The majority of H. influenzae isolates were encapsulated (18/21), with 13 type b (Hib) representing 62% of all H. influenzae isolate or 11% of all samples (13/118), and there were only 3 non-typeable isolates. Despite high antibiotic resistance, amoxicillin/clavulanate susceptibility was high. No pneumococcal vaccine use was reported.\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\nS. pneumoniae and H. influenzae, both frequently antibiotic resistant, were leading causes of bacterial AOM and there was an unexpectedly high burden of Hib in this population unvaccinated by any Hib conjugate vaccine. Conjugate vaccines effective against pneumococcus and H. influenzae could potentially reduce the burden of AOM in this population.','2014','Jun','20','2014-06-24 21:35:40',NULL,1,1);
